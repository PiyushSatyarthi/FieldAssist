TITLE: Humane Slaughter for Food Survival

KEYWORDS: slaughter, humane killing, animal processing, food survival, necessary killing, animal welfare

SEVERITY LEVELS:
- Necessary: Humane slaughter for food survival, minimal suffering
- Questionable: Slaughter when not necessary, or inhumane methods
- Unacceptable: Unnecessary killing, inhumane methods, animal suffering without purpose

CROSS-RAG TRIGGERS:
- Injury during slaughter → Medical RAG (wound_care.md, bleeding.md) - IMMEDIATE
- Burns from processing → Medical RAG (burns.md)
- Food poisoning from meat → Medical RAG (food_poisoning.md, meat_handling.md)
- Disease from sick animal → Medical RAG (food_poisoning.md, respiratory_illness.md)
- Psychological distress → Acknowledge, focus on necessity

WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE:
- Slaughter is necessary for food survival
- No other food sources available
- Animal is healthy and suitable for consumption
- Humane slaughter is required
- Food security depends on animal

IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES:
1. Preserve life - Food is necessary for survival
2. Minimize animal suffering (humane principles)
3. Ensure human safety during process
4. Prevent disease transmission
5. Process meat safely

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Inhumane methods cause unnecessary suffering
- Injury risk during process → Medical RAG
- Disease risk from sick animals
- Contamination risk during processing
- Time is critical: Process quickly and humanely

STEP-BY-STEP ACTIONS:

1. PREPARE BEFORE SLAUGHTER:
   - Ensure animal is healthy (do not slaughter sick animals)
   - Have sharp, clean tools ready
   - Prepare processing area
   - Have containers for blood and organs
   - Ensure adequate help if needed
   - Prepare for immediate processing

2. HUMANE KILLING (MINIMIZE SUFFERING):
   - Use method that causes immediate unconsciousness
   - For small animals: Sharp blow to head (instant)
   - For larger animals: Requires more force (be certain)
   - Must be immediate and effective
   - Do not use methods that cause prolonged suffering
   - If uncertain of method: Do not proceed

3. IMMEDIATE BLEEDING:
   - Begin bleeding immediately after killing
   - Cut major blood vessels (throat area)
   - Allow blood to drain
   - Important for meat quality and safety
   - See meat_processing.md for details

4. PROCESS QUICKLY:
   - Process immediately after killing
   - Do not delay
   - Maintain cleanliness
   - Prevent contamination
   - See meat_processing.md for processing steps

FOR SPECIFIC CROPS / ANIMALS / CONDITIONS:

SMALL ANIMALS (CHICKENS, RABBITS):
- Smaller, easier to handle
- Humane method: Sharp blow to head (instant)
- Process immediately
- Lower injury risk
- Still requires care and respect

LARGER ANIMALS (GOATS, SHEEP, PIGS):
- Larger, more difficult
- Requires more force for humane killing
- May require assistance
- Higher injury risk → Medical RAG if injured
- Must be certain of method before proceeding

SICK ANIMALS:
- DO NOT SLAUGHTER SICK ANIMALS
- Disease risk to humans → Medical RAG
- Meat may be unsafe
- Isolate and monitor
- Only slaughter healthy animals
- If animal dies of disease: Do not consume

PREGNANT ANIMALS:
- Consider carefully
- May provide more food if allowed to give birth
- Slaughter only if necessary for immediate food
- Consider future food production
- Make decision based on food security needs

VITAL SIGNS TO CHECK:

ANIMAL HEALTH BEFORE SLAUGHTER:
- Appetite: Normal (healthy) vs decreased (may be sick - do not slaughter)
- Activity: Normal (healthy) vs lethargic (may be sick - do not slaughter)
- Behavior: Normal (healthy) vs unusual (may be sick - do not slaughter)
- Body condition: Healthy vs thin (may be sick - do not slaughter)
- Breathing: Normal (healthy) vs difficulty (sick - do not slaughter)

HUMAN SAFETY:
- Tools: Sharp and clean
- Area: Prepared and safe
- Help: Available if needed
- Injury risk: Minimize → Medical RAG if injured
- Contamination risk: Minimize

AFTER SLAUGHTER (MONITOR FOR):
- Meat quality: Normal vs unusual
- Contamination: Present or absent
- Disease signs in meat: Present or absent (do not consume if present)
- If illness after eating → Medical RAG (food_poisoning.md)

WHEN PROFESSIONAL HELP IS UNAVAILABLE:

WHAT YOU CAN DO:
- Slaughter only if necessary for food
- Use most humane method available
- Process immediately and safely
- Maintain cleanliness
- Do not consume if animal was sick
- If injured during process → Medical RAG

REALITY CHECK:
- Slaughter is necessary for food survival
- Must be done humanely
- Some risk remains
- Difficult but necessary
- Focus on necessity and humanity

LONG-TERM CARE:

MAINTAIN ANIMAL WELFARE:
- Only slaughter when necessary
- Use humane methods
- Process respectfully
- Do not cause unnecessary suffering
- Maintain ethical standards

MANAGE FOOD SUPPLY:
- Balance animal care with food needs
- Plan slaughter when necessary
- Maintain breeding stock if possible
- Consider long-term food security
- Make difficult decisions when necessary

PREVENTION:

PREVENT UNNECESSARY KILLING:
- Only slaughter when necessary for food
- Do not kill for convenience
- Maintain animals for food production
- Plan for long-term needs
- Consider breeding if possible

MAINTAIN SAFETY:
- Use proper methods
- Maintain clean tools
- Process safely
- Prevent injury → Medical RAG if occurs
- Prevent contamination

REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS:

WITH PROPER METHODS:
- Slaughter can be done humanely
- Meat can be processed safely
- Some risk remains
- Focus on necessity and humanity
- Most can be done safely

WITHOUT PROPER METHODS:
- Animal suffering increases
- Human injury risk increases → Medical RAG
- Meat quality decreases
- Disease risk increases → Medical RAG
- Focus on best available methods

DO NOT:
- DO NOT slaughter sick animals (disease risk) → Medical RAG
- DO NOT use inhumane methods (unnecessary suffering)
- DO NOT slaughter unnecessarily (only for food survival)
- DO NOT ignore injury risk → Medical RAG
- DO NOT consume meat from sick animals → Medical RAG
- DO NOT delay processing (meat quality and safety)
- DO NOT ignore contamination risk

MYTHS CORRECTED:
- "Any method is fine" - FALSE: Must be humane and immediate
- "Sick animals are still good to eat" - FALSE: Do not consume sick animals, disease risk
- "Slaughter is easy" - FALSE: Requires care, respect, and proper methods
- "You can't be humane in survival" - FALSE: Humane methods are always possible and required

ETHICAL PRINCIPLES:
- Only kill when necessary for food survival
- Minimize animal suffering
- Use most humane method available
- Process respectfully
- Do not cause unnecessary suffering
- Maintain ethical standards even in survival
