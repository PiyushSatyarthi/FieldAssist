WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE:
- Feeding animals for food production
- Maintaining animal health
- Determining feed safety
- Managing animal nutrition
- No access to commercial feed

IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES:
1. Preserve life - Animal health affects food supply and human safety
2. Provide adequate nutrition
3. Provide adequate water
4. Prevent disease
5. Maintain animal welfare

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Starvation kills animals (wasted resource)
- Inadequate water kills animals quickly
- Disease can spread to humans (zoonotic)
- Sick animals should not be consumed
- Time is critical: Animals need daily care

STEP-BY-STEP ACTIONS:

1. PROVIDE ADEQUATE WATER:
   - Animals need water daily
   - Water requirements vary by species and size
   - Provide clean water → Food & Water RAG (water_sources.md, water_purification.md)
   - Ensure water is accessible
   - Monitor water availability
   - Animals can die quickly without water

2. PROVIDE ADEQUATE FOOD:
   - Animals need food daily
   - Food requirements vary by species
   - Provide appropriate food for species
   - Ensure food is safe (see below)
   - Monitor food availability
   - Adjust amounts based on animal condition

3. MONITOR ANIMAL HEALTH:
   - Check animals daily
   - Watch for signs of illness
   - Watch for signs of starvation
   - Watch for signs of dehydration
   - Address problems early
   - Isolate sick animals

4. PREVENT DISEASE:
   - Keep feeding areas clean
   - Provide clean water
   - Avoid contaminated feed
   - Isolate sick animals
   - Practice good hygiene
   - Some diseases can spread to humans → Medical RAG

FOR SPECIFIC CROPS / ANIMALS / CONDITIONS:

CHICKENS:
- Water: Need constant access to clean water
- Food: Grains, kitchen scraps (safe ones), insects
- Safe scraps: Vegetable scraps, grains, bread
- Unsafe scraps: Meat, spoiled food, toxic plants
- Monitor: Activity, appetite, water intake
- Disease signs: Lethargy, loss of appetite, unusual behavior → Isolate, may indicate disease

GOATS/SHEEP:
- Water: Need daily water (2-5 liters depending on size)
- Food: Grass, hay, grains, safe kitchen scraps
- Safe scraps: Vegetable scraps, bread, grains
- Unsafe scraps: Meat, spoiled food, toxic plants
- Monitor: Appetite, water intake, behavior
- Disease signs: Lethargy, loss of appetite, difficulty breathing → Isolate, may indicate zoonotic disease → Medical RAG

PIGS:
- Water: Need daily water (5-10 liters depending on size)
- Food: Grains, vegetables, safe kitchen scraps
- Safe scraps: Most vegetable scraps, grains, bread
- Unsafe scraps: Spoiled food, toxic plants, raw meat (disease risk)
- Monitor: Appetite, water intake, behavior
- Disease signs: Lethargy, loss of appetite, fever → Isolate, may indicate zoonotic disease → Medical RAG

RABBITS:
- Water: Need constant access to clean water
- Food: Grass, hay, vegetables, safe kitchen scraps
- Safe scraps: Vegetable scraps, leafy greens
- Unsafe scraps: Meat, spoiled food, toxic plants
- Monitor: Appetite, water intake, activity
- Disease signs: Lethargy, loss of appetite → Isolate

VITAL SIGNS TO CHECK:

ANIMAL HEALTH:
- Appetite: Normal vs decreased (starvation risk)
- Water intake: Normal vs decreased (dehydration risk)
- Activity: Normal vs lethargic (illness sign)
- Behavior: Normal vs unusual (illness sign)
- Body condition: Healthy vs thin (starvation)

STARVATION SIGNS:
- Loss of appetite
- Weight loss
- Lethargy
- Weakness
- Visible ribs/spine
- If severe: Animal suffering, may not recover

DEHYDRATION SIGNS:
- Decreased water intake
- Dry mouth/nose
- Sunken eyes
- Lethargy
- If severe: Animal may die quickly

DISEASE SIGNS:
- Loss of appetite
- Lethargy
- Difficulty breathing
- Discharge from eyes/nose
- Unusual behavior
- Fever (if detectable)
- Some diseases can spread to humans → Medical RAG

HUMAN SAFETY:
- Injury from handling → Medical RAG (wound_care.md, bleeding.md)
- Zoonotic disease exposure → Medical RAG (food_poisoning.md, respiratory_illness.md)
- Dehydration from work → Food & Water RAG (hydration_requirements.md)

WHEN PROFESSIONAL HELP IS UNAVAILABLE:

WHAT YOU CAN DO:
- Provide adequate food and water
- Monitor animal health
- Isolate sick animals
- Practice good hygiene
- Do not consume sick animals
- If zoonotic disease suspected → Medical RAG

REALITY CHECK:
- Some animals may not survive
- Disease may spread
- Resources may be limited
- Difficult decisions may be necessary
- Focus on maintaining healthy animals

LONG-TERM CARE:

MAINTAIN ANIMAL HEALTH:
- Provide consistent care
- Monitor regularly
- Address problems early
- Maintain clean conditions
- Practice good hygiene

MANAGE RESOURCES:
- Balance animal needs with available resources
- Prioritize water for animals → Food & Water RAG
- Use safe feed sources
- Prevent waste
- Make difficult decisions if necessary

PREVENTION:

PREVENT STARVATION:
- Provide adequate food
- Monitor animal condition
- Adjust feeding as needed
- Prevent food waste
- Plan for feed supply

PREVENT DISEASE:
- Keep areas clean
- Provide clean water → Food & Water RAG
- Avoid contaminated feed
- Isolate sick animals
- Practice good hygiene
- Some diseases can spread to humans → Medical RAG

REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS:

WITH PROPER CARE:
- Animals can remain healthy
- Most can be maintained
- Some losses are normal
- Focus on maintaining healthy animals
- Resources must be available

WITHOUT ADEQUATE RESOURCES:
- Animals may not survive
- Difficult decisions necessary
- Some may need to be culled humanely
- Focus on maintaining what is possible
- Accept limitations

DO NOT:
- DO NOT feed spoiled food to animals (disease risk)
- DO NOT feed toxic plants to animals
- DO NOT ignore starvation signs (animal suffering)
- DO NOT ignore dehydration (animals die quickly)
- DO NOT consume sick animals (disease risk) → Medical RAG
- DO NOT ignore zoonotic disease signs → Medical RAG
- DO NOT ignore animal suffering

MYTHS CORRECTED:
- "Animals can eat anything" - FALSE: Some foods are toxic or unsafe
- "Animals don't need much water" - FALSE: Animals need adequate water daily
- "Sick animals are still good to eat" - FALSE: Do not consume sick animals, disease risk
- "Animals are self-sufficient" - FALSE: Animals need daily care and resources
