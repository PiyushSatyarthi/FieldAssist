WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE:
- Slaughter of cattle (cows, bulls, steers) is necessary for food survival
- No other adequate food sources available
- Animal is healthy and suitable for consumption
- Humane slaughter is required for large animals
- Food security depends on processing cattle
- Multiple people may be available to assist (cattle are large)

IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES:
1. Preserve human life - Food is necessary for survival
2. Minimize animal suffering through immediate, effective humane methods
3. Ensure human safety during process (cattle are large and powerful)
4. Prevent disease transmission from animal to humans
5. Process meat quickly to prevent spoilage
6. Maximize food yield from large animal
7. Preserve meat safely for long-term storage

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Inhumane methods cause prolonged animal suffering and poor meat quality
- Injury risk during process is high with large animals → Medical RAG if injured
- Disease risk from sick animals can cause severe human illness or death
- Contamination risk during processing makes meat unsafe
- Time is critical: Large animals must be processed quickly to prevent spoilage
- Improper bleeding causes poor meat quality and faster spoilage
- Delayed processing allows bacterial growth and meat spoilage
- Large animal size increases physical danger to humans during process

STEP-BY-STEP ACTIONS:

1. PREPARATION BEFORE SLAUGHTER (CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP):
   - Assess animal health thoroughly: Normal appetite, normal activity, normal breathing, normal behavior, healthy body condition
   - Do not slaughter if animal shows signs of illness: Decreased appetite, lethargy, difficulty breathing, unusual behavior, thin body condition
   - Gather all necessary tools: Very sharp, heavy knife or axe for initial strike, sharp knives for bleeding and processing, rope for restraint if needed, containers for blood and organs, clean surfaces for meat
   - Prepare processing area: Clean, level ground, adequate space for large animal, drainage for blood, protection from flies and pests, shade if possible
   - Ensure adequate help: Cattle are large (400-1500+ pounds), require multiple people for safe handling, at least 2-3 strong adults recommended, more people make process safer and faster
   - Prepare for immediate processing: Have preservation methods ready (see meat_preservation.md), prepare storage containers, have cooling method available
   - Plan for large quantity: Cattle provide 400-800+ pounds of meat, requires significant processing time, requires adequate storage capacity
   - Restrain animal if necessary: Use rope halter, secure to solid post or tree, ensure animal cannot move freely, but do not cause stress or injury during restraint

2. HUMANE KILLING METHOD FOR CATTLE (MUST BE IMMEDIATE AND EFFECTIVE):
   - Cattle require powerful, immediate method due to large size and thick skull
   - Most effective method: Powerful blow to head with heavy, blunt object (sledgehammer, large axe handle, heavy club)
   - Target location: Center of forehead, between eyes, slightly above eye level
   - Force required: Must be sufficient to cause immediate unconsciousness, requires significant strength, single powerful strike is essential
   - Why this matters: Immediate unconsciousness prevents animal suffering, ineffective strike causes prolonged suffering and poor meat quality, animal may become dangerous if not immediately unconscious
   - Alternative method (if firearm available): Shot to brain at same location, must be immediately effective, requires proper firearm and ammunition
   - Do not use: Throat cutting without stunning (causes prolonged suffering), methods that do not cause immediate unconsciousness, methods that require multiple attempts
   - Verify unconsciousness: Animal must be completely still, no movement, no response to stimulus, eyes fixed and unresponsive
   - If animal is not immediately unconscious: Second strike may be necessary, but this indicates first method was inadequate, causes additional suffering

3. IMMEDIATE BLEEDING (CRITICAL - BEGIN WITHIN SECONDS):
   - Begin bleeding immediately after animal is unconscious and still
   - Location: Throat area, major blood vessels (carotid arteries, jugular veins)
   - Method: Deep cut across throat, sever major vessels completely, allow blood to drain freely
   - Why immediate bleeding matters: Removes blood from meat (improves quality and storage), prevents blood pooling in tissues, begins cooling process, essential for meat safety
   - Blood collection: Collect in clean container if possible (can be used for other purposes), prevent contamination of meat area, allow complete drainage
   - Complete drainage: Allow 5-10 minutes for blood to drain, animal should be positioned with head lower than body, ensure all major vessels are severed
   - Do not delay: Every minute of delay reduces meat quality, allows blood to pool in tissues, increases spoilage risk

4. POSITIONING FOR PROCESSING:
   - Position animal on its back or side for easier access
   - Large animals may require rolling or positioning with help
   - Ensure stable position: Animal will not roll or move during processing, provides access to all areas, allows drainage
   - Head should be lower than body: Aids blood drainage, prevents blood pooling
   - Secure position: May require ropes or stakes to maintain position, prevents movement during processing, ensures safety

5. SKINNING (REMOVE HIDE):
   - Begin at legs: Cut around each leg at ankle/hock, make vertical cuts up leg, connect cuts at body
   - Work systematically: Remove hide from legs first, then work up body, maintain clean cuts, do not cut into meat
   - Preserve hide if possible: Hide has value for other uses, remove carefully to preserve, store separately
   - Why careful skinning matters: Prevents contamination of meat with hide, preserves hide for other uses, maintains meat quality
   - Use sharp knife: Dull knife requires more force and causes errors, sharp knife makes clean cuts, reduces contamination risk
   - Work quickly: Large hide removal takes time, but work efficiently, prevent delays in processing

6. OPENING BODY CAVITY:
   - Make careful incision: Start at lower abdomen, cut upward along centerline, avoid cutting into organs, cut through abdominal wall only
   - Why careful cutting matters: Puncturing organs contaminates meat, intestinal contents are highly contaminated, must prevent organ rupture
   - Extend cut: From lower abdomen to chest, follow natural body lines, maintain single clean cut
   - Open carefully: Use hands to separate, do not force with knife, prevent organ damage
   - Expose organs: All internal organs should be visible, ready for inspection and removal

7. REMOVE INTERNAL ORGANS (CRITICAL FOR SAFETY):
   - Remove organs carefully: Do not puncture any organ, especially intestines and stomach, intestinal contents are highly contaminated
   - Remove digestive tract: Stomach and intestines must be removed intact, any rupture contaminates meat, dispose of properly away from processing area
   - Remove other organs: Liver, heart, kidneys, lungs, spleen, all must be removed, inspect each carefully
   - Why careful removal matters: Organ rupture contaminates meat with bacteria, makes meat unsafe, causes food poisoning → Medical RAG
   - Work systematically: Remove organs in logical order, prevent damage, maintain cleanliness
   - Keep meat clean: Do not allow organ contents to contact meat, wash hands frequently, use clean tools

8. ORGAN INSPECTION (CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP):
   - Inspect liver: Should be uniform dark red/brown color, firm texture, no white spots, no abscesses, no unusual discoloration
   - Inspect lungs: Should be pink, uniform color, no spots, no discoloration, no hard areas, no fluid
   - Inspect heart: Should be normal size and shape, no abnormalities, no spots, normal color
   - Inspect kidneys: Should be normal shape, no spots, no discoloration, no swelling
   - Inspect lymph nodes: Should be normal size, not enlarged, not discolored
   - Abnormal findings: White spots on liver indicate possible disease, discolored organs indicate disease, abscesses indicate infection, enlarged lymph nodes indicate disease
   - If any organ is abnormal: Do not consume meat from this animal, disease risk is too high → Medical RAG, dispose of meat properly, do not feed to other animals
   - When in doubt: Do not consume, better to waste meat than risk severe illness or death
   - Why inspection matters: Many diseases show in organs before meat, consuming diseased meat causes severe illness, can be fatal → Medical RAG

9. SEPARATE MEAT FROM BONES:
   - Remove head: Cut at neck, inspect head if needed, remove tongue (edible), remove brain (edible but higher disease risk)
   - Remove legs: Cut at joints, separate into sections, each leg provides significant meat
   - Remove major muscle groups: Separate along natural muscle boundaries, identify major cuts (shoulder, rib, loin, round, etc.)
   - Why proper separation matters: Different cuts have different uses, proper separation improves preservation, allows efficient processing
   - Work systematically: Process one section at a time, maintain organization, prevent waste
   - Preserve all usable meat: Large animals provide significant food, do not waste, use all edible portions

10. COOLING MEAT (CRITICAL - BEGIN IMMEDIATELY):
    - Large animals produce large amounts of meat that must be cooled quickly
    - Method 1 - Hanging: Hang large pieces in cool, shaded area, allow air circulation, protect from flies and pests, cool as quickly as possible
    - Method 2 - Immediate processing: Cut into smaller pieces for faster cooling, process immediately if possible, do not leave large pieces at room temperature
    - Why rapid cooling matters: Meat spoils quickly at warm temperatures, bacterial growth is rapid, cooling preserves meat quality, essential for safety
    - Temperature goal: Cool to below 40°F (4°C) as quickly as possible, within 2-4 hours if possible, faster is better
    - If cooling not possible: Process immediately into preservation (see meat_preservation.md), do not delay, spoilage begins immediately
    - Protect from contamination: Keep meat clean during cooling, protect from flies, protect from other animals, maintain cleanliness

11. INITIAL MEAT PROCESSING:
    - Remove excess fat: Some fat is useful, excess fat spoils faster, trim as needed
    - Remove connective tissue: Some is edible, remove tough portions, improve meat quality
    - Cut into manageable pieces: Size depends on preservation method, smaller pieces cool faster, easier to handle
    - Prepare for preservation: See meat_preservation.md for methods, begin preservation immediately, do not delay

12. CLEAN UP AND DISPOSAL:
    - Dispose of waste properly: Bury organs and waste away from water sources, away from living areas, deep enough to prevent animal access
    - Clean all tools thoroughly: Wash with soap and water, sanitize if possible, prevent contamination of future use
    - Clean processing area: Remove all waste, clean surfaces, prevent contamination, maintain hygiene
    - Why proper disposal matters: Waste attracts pests and predators, can contaminate water sources, creates health hazards
    - Store tools properly: Clean and dry tools, prevent rust, ready for next use

FOR SPECIFIC CONDITIONS / ANIMALS:

HEALTHY ADULT CATTLE:
- Best case scenario: Healthy animal, good body condition, provides maximum meat yield
- Process as described above
- Expect 400-800+ pounds of meat depending on size
- All steps apply as described

YOUNG CATTLE (CALVES):
- Smaller size: Easier to handle, requires less force for humane killing, faster processing
- Less meat: Still significant amount (100-300 pounds), adequate for food needs
- Same process: All steps apply, but faster due to smaller size
- May require less help: 1-2 people may be sufficient

SICK CATTLE:
- DO NOT SLAUGHTER SICK CATTLE: Disease risk to humans is too high → Medical RAG
- Signs of illness: Decreased appetite, lethargy, difficulty breathing, unusual behavior, thin body condition, discharge from eyes/nose, abnormal feces
- If animal dies of disease: Do not consume meat, disease risk is too high, dispose of properly
- Why this matters: Many cattle diseases can transmit to humans, cause severe illness or death, not worth the risk

PREGNANT CATTLE:
- Consider carefully: Pregnant animal may provide more food if allowed to give birth first, calf provides additional food, but requires time and resources
- Decision factors: Immediate food need vs future food production, resources available for calf care, long-term food security
- If slaughtering pregnant animal: Process as normal, fetus may be edible if developed, inspect carefully, same safety standards apply
- If allowing birth: Requires additional resources, calf needs care, but provides future food source

ELDERLY OR THIN CATTLE:
- Lower meat yield: Less meat than healthy adult, but still significant
- Meat quality: May be tougher, but still edible and nutritious
- Process normally: All steps apply, may require more processing time
- Use all edible portions: Do not waste, all meat is valuable

VITAL SIGNS TO CHECK:

ANIMAL HEALTH BEFORE SLAUGHTER:
- Appetite: Normal eating (healthy) vs decreased or no appetite (sick - do not slaughter)
- Activity: Normal movement and behavior (healthy) vs lethargy or weakness (sick - do not slaughter)
- Breathing: Normal, regular breathing (healthy) vs difficulty breathing, coughing (sick - do not slaughter)
- Body condition: Good muscle mass, healthy appearance (healthy) vs thin, poor condition (may be sick - do not slaughter)
- Behavior: Normal behavior for animal (healthy) vs unusual behavior, isolation (sick - do not slaughter)
- Eyes and nose: Clear, no discharge (healthy) vs discharge, cloudiness (sick - do not slaughter)
- Feces: Normal consistency and color (healthy) vs diarrhea, unusual color (sick - do not slaughter)

HUMAN SAFETY DURING PROCESS:
- Tools: Sharp and clean, appropriate size for large animal, in good condition
- Area: Prepared and safe, adequate space, stable ground, no hazards
- Help: Adequate number of people (2-3+ for cattle), people are strong enough, people understand process
- Injury risk: Minimize through proper methods, have first aid ready → Medical RAG if injury occurs
- Contamination risk: Minimize through cleanliness, prevent contact with waste

MEAT QUALITY AFTER PROCESSING:
- Color: Normal red color for beef (healthy) vs unusual color, gray, green (spoiled - do not consume)
- Texture: Firm, normal texture (healthy) vs soft, mushy (spoiled - do not consume)
- Smell: Normal meat smell (healthy) vs foul, sour, putrid smell (spoiled - do not consume)
- Temperature: Cool (safe) vs warm (spoilage risk - cool immediately)
- Contamination: No visible contamination (safe) vs visible contamination (unsafe - do not consume)

ORGAN INSPECTION FINDINGS:
- Normal: All organs appear healthy, normal color, normal texture, no abnormalities
- Abnormal: Any organ shows spots, discoloration, abscesses, unusual texture, foul smell
- Decision: Normal organs = meat may be safe (still inspect meat), abnormal organs = do not consume meat → Medical RAG

AFTER CONSUMPTION (MONITOR FOR):
- Normal: No symptoms after eating (safe)
- Symptoms: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, abdominal pain (food poisoning - IMMEDIATE → Medical RAG)
- If symptoms develop: Stop eating meat immediately, seek medical help if available → Medical RAG, preserve sample if possible for identification
