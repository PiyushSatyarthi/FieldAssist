- Critical: Complete crop failure, starvation risk, no food production

CROSS-RAG TRIGGERS:
- Dehydration from farming work → Food & Water RAG (hydration_requirements.md, dehydration.md) - IMMEDIATE
- Heat illness from farming → Medical RAG (heat_stroke.md) - IMMEDIATE
- Diarrhea from contaminated produce → Medical RAG (diarrhea.md, food_poisoning.md)
- Food poisoning from produce → Medical RAG (food_poisoning.md)
- Injury from farming tools → Medical RAG (wound_care.md, bleeding.md)

WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE:
- Need to grow food for survival
- No access to external food supply
- Long-term survival situation
- Establishing food production
- Managing crops for food security

IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES:
1. Preserve life - Food production prevents starvation
2. Establish reliable food source
3. Maintain adequate water supply
4. Prevent crop failures
5. Manage resources efficiently

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Crop failure can lead to starvation
- Inadequate water kills crops
- Poor soil produces inadequate food
- Pests can destroy entire crops
- Time is critical: Crops take weeks to months to produce

STEP-BY-STEP ACTIONS:

1. ASSESS SOIL:
   - Soil should be loose and workable
   - Should drain water (not stay waterlogged)
   - Should hold some water (not drain immediately)
   - Remove large rocks and debris
   - Test by digging - should be workable
   - Do not need perfect soil - work with what you have

2. PREPARE SOIL:
   - Loosen soil to depth of 6-12 inches (15-30cm)
   - Remove weeds and large debris
   - Break up large clumps
   - Level area if possible
   - Do not overwork - basic preparation is enough

3. PLANTING:
   - Follow seed instructions for depth and spacing
   - Plant at appropriate time (season matters)
   - Water after planting
   - Mark planting areas
   - Keep records if possible (what, when, where)

4. WATERING:
   - Most crops need consistent water
   - Water when soil is dry to touch
   - Water deeply but not too frequently
   - Avoid waterlogging
   - Morning watering is best (reduces evaporation)
   - Monitor water needs → Food & Water RAG (water_sources.md, hydration_requirements.md)

5. WEEDING:
   - Remove weeds regularly
   - Weeds compete for water and nutrients
   - Remove when small (easier)
   - Do not let weeds go to seed
   - Maintain weed-free area around crops

6. MONITORING:
   - Check crops regularly
   - Watch for problems (pests, disease, water issues)
   - Address problems early
   - Monitor growth
   - Adjust practices as needed

FOR SPECIFIC CROPS / ANIMALS / CONDITIONS:

FAST-GROWING CROPS (QUICK FOOD):
- Leafy greens: 30-60 days
- Radishes: 30-40 days
- Beans: 50-70 days
- Good for immediate food needs
- Plant multiple times for continuous harvest

STAPLE CROPS (CALORIES):
- Potatoes: 90-120 days
- Corn: 70-100 days
- Squash: 60-90 days
- Provide calories for survival
- Require more space and time

ROOT CROPS:
- Store well if conditions right
- Provide calories
- Can be left in ground longer
- Good for survival situations

LEGUMES (PROTEIN):
- Beans, peas provide protein
- Important for nutrition
- Some fix nitrogen in soil (helps soil)
- Require support for some varieties

WATER REQUIREMENTS:
- Most crops need consistent water
- Drought-tolerant crops: Corn, beans, squash (some varieties)
- Water-intensive crops: Leafy greens, most vegetables
- Plan water use → Food & Water RAG (water_sources.md, hydration_requirements.md)
- Monitor water availability

VITAL SIGNS TO CHECK:

CROP HEALTH:
- Leaves: Green and healthy vs yellow/wilted
- Growth: Normal vs stunted
- Pests: Present or absent
- Disease: Present or absent
- Water: Adequate or inadequate

SOIL CONDITION:
- Moisture: Adequate or too dry/wet
- Drainage: Good or poor
- Workability: Good or poor
- Nutrients: May be limited (work with what you have)

WATER AVAILABILITY:
- Water source: Available or limited → Food & Water RAG (water_sources.md)
- Water quality: Suitable or questionable → Food & Water RAG (water_purification.md)
- Water quantity: Adequate or inadequate → Food & Water RAG (hydration_requirements.md)

HUMAN CONDITION (FARMING WORK):
- Dehydration from work → Food & Water RAG (hydration_requirements.md, dehydration.md) - IMMEDIATE
- Heat illness from work → Medical RAG (heat_stroke.md) - IMMEDIATE
- Fatigue: Monitor, rest as needed
- Injury from tools → Medical RAG (wound_care.md, bleeding.md)

WHEN PROFESSIONAL HELP IS UNAVAILABLE:

WHAT YOU CAN DO:
- Work with available resources
- Use simple methods
- Learn from experience
- Adapt to conditions
- Focus on reliable crops
- Monitor and adjust

REALITY CHECK:
- Crop failures are common
- Yields may be lower than expected
- Some crops may not grow in conditions
- Focus on what works
- Accept limitations

LONG-TERM CARE:

CROP ROTATION (SIMPLE VERSION):
- Do not plant same crop in same place repeatedly
- Rotate between different crop types
- Helps prevent disease and nutrient depletion
- Simple rotation: Legumes → Leafy crops → Root crops
- Return to original after 3-4 seasons

SOIL MAINTENANCE:
- Add organic matter if available (compost, manure)
- Do not overwork soil
- Allow soil to rest between crops if possible
- Work with natural soil fertility
- Accept limitations

SEED SAVING:
- Save seeds from best plants
- Dry properly (see seed_preservation.md)
- Store correctly
- Maintain seed supply
- Critical for long-term survival

PREVENTION:

PREVENT CROP FAILURES:
- Plant appropriate crops for conditions
- Maintain adequate water
- Control weeds
- Monitor for problems
- Address issues early

MAINTAIN RESOURCES:
- Conserve water → Food & Water RAG
- Save seeds (see seed_preservation.md)
- Maintain tools
- Plan for seasons
- Store harvest properly

REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS:

WITH PROPER PRACTICES:
- Some crops will succeed
- Yields may be lower than ideal
- Some failures are normal
- Focus on reliable crops
- Most can produce some food

WITHOUT IDEAL CONDITIONS:
- Crop failures are common
- Yields will be lower
- Some crops may not grow
- Focus on what works
- Accept limitations

YIELD REALISM:
- Survival farming: Lower yields than commercial
- Weather affects yields significantly
- Pests and disease reduce yields
- Some crop loss is normal
- Plan for lower yields

DO NOT:
- DO NOT overwork soil (damages structure)
- DO NOT ignore water needs → Food & Water RAG
- DO NOT ignore crop problems
- DO NOT plant all crops at once (spread risk)
- DO NOT ignore seed saving (critical for long-term)
- DO NOT ignore dehydration from work → Food & Water RAG, Medical RAG
- DO NOT ignore heat illness from work → Medical RAG

MYTHS CORRECTED:
- "Any soil will work" - FALSE: Some soil is too poor, but work with what you have
- "More water is always better" - FALSE: Waterlogging kills crops
- "All crops grow everywhere" - FALSE: Climate and season matter
- "First year will be productive" - FALSE: May take time to establish
