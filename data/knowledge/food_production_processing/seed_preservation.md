TITLE: Seed Preservation and Storage

KEYWORDS: seed preservation, seed storage, seed viability, seed drying, seed selection, seed saving

SEVERITY LEVELS:
- Viable: Seeds that will germinate and grow
- Questionable: Seeds that may or may not germinate
- Non-viable: Seeds that will not germinate, wasted resources

CROSS-RAG TRIGGERS:
- Mold in stored seeds → Discard, may cause illness if consumed
- Contaminated seeds → Discard, do not plant or eat
- Food poisoning from seeds → Medical RAG (food_poisoning.md)
- Dehydration from seed work → Food & Water RAG (hydration_requirements.md)

WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE:
- Saving seeds for next season
- Storing seeds long-term
- Determining if seeds are still viable
- Preserving seed supply
- No access to commercial seeds

IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES:
1. Preserve life - Seeds are critical for long-term food production
2. Maintain seed viability
3. Prevent spoilage
4. Ensure future food production
5. Protect seed supply

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Seed loss means no future crops
- Poor storage destroys seeds
- Mold makes seeds unusable
- Moisture destroys seeds
- Time is critical: Seeds must be preserved properly

STEP-BY-STEP ACTIONS:

1. SELECT SEEDS TO SAVE:
   - Choose from best, healthiest plants
   - Choose fully mature seeds
   - Avoid seeds from diseased plants
   - Avoid seeds from weak plants
   - Quality matters for future crops

2. HARVEST SEEDS:
   - Wait until seeds are fully mature
   - Harvest when dry (if possible)
   - Handle carefully to avoid damage
   - Collect cleanly
   - Remove plant debris

3. DRY SEEDS:
   - Seeds must be dry for storage
   - Spread in single layer
   - Dry in shade (sun can damage)
   - Allow air circulation
   - Dry until hard and brittle
   - Test: Seeds should snap, not bend

4. CLEAN SEEDS:
   - Remove plant debris
   - Remove damaged seeds
   - Remove immature seeds
   - Keep only good seeds
   - Clean seeds store better

5. STORE PROPERLY:
   - Store in cool, dry place
   - Use airtight containers if possible
   - Label with crop type and date
   - Keep away from moisture
   - Keep away from pests
   - Monitor regularly

FOR SPECIFIC CROPS / ANIMALS / CONDITIONS:

DRY SEEDS (BEANS, CORN, ETC.):
- Must be completely dry
- Store in dry containers
- Keep away from moisture
- Can store for years if dry
- Monitor for mold

WET SEEDS (TOMATOES, CUCUMBERS, ETC.):
- Must ferment or dry properly
- Remove pulp before storage
- Dry completely
- More difficult to preserve
- Shorter storage life

SMALL SEEDS:
- More difficult to clean
- Handle carefully
- Store in small containers
- Label clearly
- Monitor closely

LARGE SEEDS:
- Easier to handle
- Easier to clean
- Store in appropriate containers
- Monitor for damage
- Generally store well

VITAL SIGNS TO CHECK:

SEED QUALITY:
- Appearance: Plump and healthy vs shriveled
- Color: Normal vs discolored
- Texture: Hard and dry vs soft/moist
- Damage: Intact vs damaged
- Mold: Absent or present (discard if present)

STORAGE CONDITIONS:
- Temperature: Cool is better
- Moisture: Dry is critical
- Air: Some air exchange is good
- Light: Dark is better
- Pests: Absent is critical

SEED VIABILITY:
- Test before planting: Soak seeds, see if they swell
- Old seeds: May have lower germination
- Monitor germination rates
- Discard if no longer viable
- Use oldest seeds first

AFTER USING SEEDS (MONITOR FOR):
- Low germination: Seeds may be old or poor quality
- Mold growth: Storage conditions inadequate
- Pest damage: Storage not pest-proof
- If seeds fail: May need new seed source

WHEN PROFESSIONAL HELP IS UNAVAILABLE:

WHAT YOU CAN DO:
- Save seeds from best plants
- Dry properly
- Store in best available conditions
- Monitor regularly
- Test viability before planting
- Accept some seed loss

REALITY CHECK:
- Some seeds will not survive storage
- Storage conditions may not be ideal
- Some seed loss is normal
- Focus on best practices available
- Accept limitations

LONG-TERM CARE:

ROTATE SEED SUPPLY:
- Use oldest seeds first
- Save new seeds each year
- Maintain seed supply
- Do not use all seeds
- Keep reserve supply

MAINTAIN STORAGE:
- Check storage regularly
- Monitor for problems
- Maintain dry conditions
- Protect from pests
- Replace containers if needed

PREVENTION:

PREVENT SEED LOSS:
- Dry seeds properly
- Store in dry conditions
- Protect from pests
- Monitor regularly
- Maintain good storage

MAINTAIN SEED SUPPLY:
- Save seeds each year
- Save from multiple plants
- Save from best plants
- Maintain variety
- Do not use all seeds

REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS:

WITH PROPER STORAGE:
- Most seeds will remain viable
- Some seed loss is normal
- Storage life varies by crop
- Most can maintain seed supply
- Some seeds store better than others

WITHOUT IDEAL STORAGE:
- More seed loss is likely
- Some seeds may not survive
- Must work with available conditions
- Focus on best practices
- Accept limitations

SEED VIABILITY LIMITS:
- Most seeds: 1-3 years if stored properly
- Some seeds: Longer (beans, corn)
- Some seeds: Shorter (onions, parsnips)
- Varies by storage conditions
- Test before planting

DO NOT:
- DO NOT store wet seeds (will mold)
- DO NOT store in moist conditions
- DO NOT ignore mold (discard contaminated seeds)
- DO NOT use all seeds (keep reserve)
- DO NOT store seeds from diseased plants
- DO NOT ignore storage conditions
- DO NOT eat moldy seeds → Medical RAG (food_poisoning.md)

MYTHS CORRECTED:
- "Seeds last forever" - FALSE: Seeds have viability limits
- "Any storage is fine" - FALSE: Moisture and pests destroy seeds
- "All seeds store the same" - FALSE: Different seeds have different storage needs
- "Moldy seeds are still usable" - FALSE: Discard moldy seeds, may cause illness
