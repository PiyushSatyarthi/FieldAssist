TITLE: Meat Processing and Cutting - Food Safety Focus

KEYWORDS: meat processing, meat cutting, bleeding, cooling, organ inspection, contamination prevention, food safety

SEVERITY LEVELS:
- Safe: Properly processed meat, no contamination
- Risky: Some contamination risk, improper processing
- Dangerous: Contaminated meat, unsafe organs, disease risk

CROSS-RAG TRIGGERS:
- Injury during processing → Medical RAG (wound_care.md, bleeding.md) - IMMEDIATE
- Burns from processing → Medical RAG (burns.md)
- Food poisoning from meat → Medical RAG (food_poisoning.md, diarrhea.md) - IMMEDIATE
- Disease from contaminated meat → Medical RAG (food_poisoning.md, respiratory_illness.md)
- Contamination during processing → Food & Water RAG (cross_contamination.md)

WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE:
- Processing meat after slaughter
- Cutting and preparing meat
- Inspecting organs
- Ensuring meat safety
- Preventing contamination

IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES:
1. Preserve life - Safe meat prevents illness
2. Prevent contamination
3. Process quickly (meat quality and safety)
4. Inspect for disease
5. Maintain cleanliness

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Contaminated meat can cause severe illness and death
- Disease in organs can spread to humans
- Improper processing allows bacterial growth
- Time is critical: Process quickly after slaughter
- Contamination during processing makes meat unsafe

STEP-BY-STEP ACTIONS:

1. BLEEDING (IMMEDIATE):
   - Begin bleeding immediately after killing
   - Cut major blood vessels (throat area)
   - Allow blood to drain completely
   - Important for meat quality
   - Do not delay

2. SKINNING/GUTTING:
   - Remove skin carefully (if needed)
   - Open body cavity carefully
   - Remove internal organs carefully
   - Do not puncture organs (contamination risk)
   - Keep meat clean during process

3. ORGAN INSPECTION (CRITICAL):
   - Inspect organs for abnormalities
   - Normal: Organs appear healthy, normal color
   - Abnormal: Discoloration, spots, unusual texture, foul smell
   - If abnormal: Do not consume meat, disease risk → Medical RAG
   - When in doubt: Do not consume

4. COOLING (IMPORTANT):
   - Cool meat as quickly as possible
   - Hang in cool place if possible
   - Allow air circulation
   - Prevent flies and pests
   - Do not leave at room temperature long
   - See meat_preservation.md for storage

5. CUTTING AND SEPARATION:
   - Use clean tools
   - Separate different cuts
   - Keep meat clean
   - Prevent cross-contamination → Food & Water RAG (cross_contamination.md)
   - Process efficiently

6. CLEAN UP:
   - Clean tools thoroughly
   - Dispose of waste properly
   - Clean processing area
   - Prevent contamination
   - Maintain hygiene

FOR SPECIFIC CROPS / ANIMALS / CONDITIONS:

POULTRY:
- Remove feathers carefully
- Remove internal organs
- Inspect organs (liver, heart, gizzard)
- Cool quickly
- Process within hours
- See meat_handling.md for cooking

LARGER ANIMALS:
- Skin carefully
- Remove internal organs
- Inspect all organs thoroughly
- Cool large pieces
- Process within hours
- May require more time

ORGAN INSPECTION:
- LIVER: Should be uniform color, no spots
- LUNGS: Should be pink, no spots or discoloration
- HEART: Should be normal, no abnormalities
- KIDNEYS: Should be normal, no spots
- INTESTINES: Should be normal (do not consume)
- If any organ abnormal: Do not consume meat → Medical RAG

VITAL SIGNS TO CHECK:

MEAT QUALITY:
- Color: Normal for species vs unusual
- Texture: Firm vs soft/mushy
- Smell: Normal vs foul (discard if foul)
- Temperature: Cool vs warm (cool quickly)
- Contamination: Present or absent

ORGAN INSPECTION:
- Appearance: Normal vs abnormal
- Color: Normal vs discolored
- Texture: Normal vs unusual
- Smell: Normal vs foul
- If abnormal: Do not consume → Medical RAG

PROCESSING SAFETY:
- Tools: Clean and sharp
- Area: Clean
- Contamination: Prevented or present
- Injury risk: Minimized → Medical RAG if injured

AFTER PROCESSING (MONITOR FOR):
- Meat spoilage → Food & Water RAG (food_spoilage_detection.md)
- Contamination → Food & Water RAG (cross_contamination.md)
- If illness after eating → Medical RAG (food_poisoning.md, diarrhea.md) - IMMEDIATE

WHEN PROFESSIONAL HELP IS UNAVAILABLE:

WHAT YOU CAN DO:
- Process quickly and cleanly
- Inspect organs carefully
- Do not consume if uncertain
- Process safely
- Maintain cleanliness
- If illness develops → Medical RAG

REALITY CHECK:
- Some contamination risk remains
- Must process quickly
- Some meat may be unsafe
- Do not consume if uncertain
- Focus on safety

LONG-TERM CARE:

MAINTAIN PROCESSING SKILLS:
- Practice proper methods
- Maintain clean tools
- Improve techniques
- Learn from experience
- Maintain safety standards

PRESERVE MEAT:
- Process quickly
- Preserve immediately (see meat_preservation.md)
- Store properly
- Monitor for spoilage
- Use before spoilage

PREVENTION:

PREVENT CONTAMINATION:
- Maintain cleanliness
- Process quickly
- Prevent cross-contamination → Food & Water RAG
- Inspect organs
- Do not consume if uncertain

MAINTAIN SAFETY:
- Use clean tools
- Process safely
- Prevent injury → Medical RAG if occurs
- Inspect carefully
- Do not consume unsafe meat

REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS:

WITH PROPER PROCESSING:
- Most meat can be processed safely
- Proper inspection prevents disease
- Some risk remains
- Most can be consumed safely
- Focus on safety

WITHOUT PROPER PROCESSING:
- Contamination risk increases
- Disease risk increases → Medical RAG
- Meat quality decreases
- Some meat may be unsafe
- Focus on best available methods

DO NOT:
- DO NOT consume meat from sick animals (disease risk) → Medical RAG
- DO NOT ignore abnormal organs (disease risk) → Medical RAG
- DO NOT delay processing (meat spoils quickly)
- DO NOT ignore contamination → Food & Water RAG
- DO NOT consume if uncertain (better to waste than get sick)
- DO NOT ignore injury during processing → Medical RAG
- DO NOT skip organ inspection (critical for safety)

MYTHS CORRECTED:
- "All meat is safe if cooked" - FALSE: Some diseases survive cooking, inspect organs
- "Abnormal organs are fine if cooked" - FALSE: Do not consume if organs abnormal
- "Processing can wait" - FALSE: Must process quickly, meat spoils
- "A little contamination won't hurt" - FALSE: Contamination can cause severe illness
