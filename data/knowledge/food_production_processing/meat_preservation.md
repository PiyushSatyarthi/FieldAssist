TITLE: Meat Preservation - Survival Methods

KEYWORDS: meat preservation, drying meat, smoking meat, salting meat, cold storage, meat spoilage, food preservation

SEVERITY LEVELS:
- Preserved: Meat properly preserved, safe to eat
- Risky: Questionable preservation, some spoilage risk
- Dangerous: Spoiled meat, unsafe to eat, disease risk

CROSS-RAG TRIGGERS:
- Food poisoning from preserved meat → Medical RAG (food_poisoning.md, diarrhea.md) - IMMEDIATE
- Vomiting after eating preserved meat → Medical RAG (food_poisoning.md, dehydration.md) - IMMEDIATE
- Spoiled meat consumption → Medical RAG (food_poisoning.md) - IMMEDIATE
- Dehydration from salt-preserved meat → Food & Water RAG (hydration_requirements.md, dehydration.md)

WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE:
- Need to preserve meat for later use
- No access to refrigeration
- Long-term food storage needed
- Preventing meat spoilage
- Survival food preservation

IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES:
1. Preserve life - Preserved meat prevents starvation
2. Prevent spoilage
3. Maintain food safety
4. Preserve food value
5. Prevent waste

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Spoiled meat can cause severe illness and death
- Improper preservation allows bacterial growth
- Contamination during preservation makes meat unsafe
- Time is critical: Preserve quickly after processing
- Eating spoiled meat can be fatal

STEP-BY-STEP ACTIONS:

1. PREPARE MEAT FOR PRESERVATION:
   - Use fresh meat (process quickly)
   - Cut into appropriate sizes
   - Remove excess fat if possible (preserves better)
   - Keep clean during preparation
   - Do not delay - preserve quickly

2. CHOOSE PRESERVATION METHOD:
   - DRYING: Works in dry conditions, requires time
   - SMOKING: Adds flavor, requires smoke source
   - SALTING: Works in various conditions, requires salt
   - COLD STORAGE: Natural cold if available
   - Choose method based on conditions and resources

3. DRYING METHOD:
   - Cut meat into thin strips
   - Hang in dry, well-ventilated area
   - Protect from flies and pests
   - Allow air circulation
   - Dry until hard and brittle
   - Takes days to weeks depending on conditions

4. SMOKING METHOD:
   - Prepare meat (cut into strips)
   - Build smoke source (small fire, smoldering)
   - Hang meat in smoke
   - Maintain smoke (not fire)
   - Smoke for hours to days
   - Then dry further if needed

5. SALTING METHOD:
   - Cover meat completely with salt
   - Use coarse salt if available
   - Ensure all surfaces covered
   - Store in cool, dry place
   - Salt draws out moisture
   - Meat becomes preserved

6. COLD STORAGE (NATURAL):
   - Use natural cold if available
   - Store in coolest location
   - Protect from animals
   - Monitor temperature
   - Use before spoilage
   - Limited by available cold

FOR SPECIFIC CROPS / ANIMALS / CONDITIONS:

DRY CONDITIONS:
- Drying works well
- Meat dries quickly
- Low humidity helps
- Monitor for complete drying
- Store in dry conditions

HUMID CONDITIONS:
- Drying is difficult
- May need smoking or salting
- Monitor for mold
- May need additional methods
- Store carefully

HOT CONDITIONS:
- Meat spoils quickly
- Must preserve immediately
- Drying may work if dry
- Salting may work
- Monitor closely

COLD CONDITIONS:
- Natural cold storage possible
- Meat keeps longer
- Still need preservation for long-term
- Monitor for freezing/thawing
- Use natural cold if available

VITAL SIGNS TO CHECK:

PRESERVATION EFFECTIVENESS:
- Drying: Hard and brittle vs soft/moist (not preserved)
- Smoking: Properly smoked vs not (may not be preserved)
- Salting: Completely covered vs not (may not be preserved)
- Cold storage: Cold enough vs not (may spoil)

SPOILAGE SIGNS:
- Appearance: Normal vs discolored
- Smell: Normal vs foul (discard if foul)
- Texture: Normal vs slimy (discard if slimy)
- Mold: Absent vs present (discard if present)
- If spoiled: Do not consume → Medical RAG (food_poisoning.md)

AFTER EATING PRESERVED MEAT (MONITOR FOR):
- Diarrhea → Medical RAG (diarrhea.md, food_poisoning.md) - IMMEDIATE
- Vomiting → Medical RAG (food_poisoning.md, dehydration.md) - IMMEDIATE
- Stomach cramps → Medical RAG (food_poisoning.md)
- Fever → Medical RAG (fever.md)
- If symptoms develop: Meat may have been spoiled → Medical RAG

WHEN PROFESSIONAL HELP IS UNAVAILABLE:

WHAT YOU CAN DO:
- Preserve using available methods
- Monitor for spoilage
- Do not consume if uncertain
- Use best available methods
- Accept limitations
- If illness develops → Medical RAG

REALITY CHECK:
- Some preservation may fail
- Some meat may spoil
- Must work with available conditions
- Some methods work better than others
- Focus on what works

LONG-TERM CARE:

MAINTAIN PRESERVED MEAT:
- Store in appropriate conditions
- Monitor for spoilage
- Rotate supply (use oldest first)
- Maintain storage area
- Prevent pests

MONITOR STORAGE:
- Check regularly
- Watch for spoilage
- Maintain conditions
- Prevent contamination
- Use before spoilage

PREVENTION:

PREVENT SPOILAGE:
- Preserve quickly
- Use proper methods
- Maintain storage conditions
- Monitor regularly
- Do not consume if uncertain

MAINTAIN FOOD SUPPLY:
- Preserve when meat available
- Rotate supply
- Use before spoilage
- Maintain variety if possible
- Plan for long-term needs

REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS:

WITH PROPER PRESERVATION:
- Most meat can be preserved
- Proper methods work well
- Some spoilage is normal
- Most can be consumed safely
- Storage life varies by method

WITHOUT IDEAL CONDITIONS:
- Preservation may be difficult
- Some methods may not work
- More spoilage is likely
- Must work with available conditions
- Focus on best available methods

PRESERVATION LIMITS:
- Drying: Months if properly dried and stored
- Smoking: Weeks to months depending on method
- Salting: Months if properly salted
- Cold storage: Days to weeks depending on temperature
- Varies by conditions and method

DO NOT:
- DO NOT consume spoiled meat (disease risk) → Medical RAG
- DO NOT ignore spoilage signs (discard if spoiled)
- DO NOT delay preservation (meat spoils quickly)
- DO NOT skip proper methods (may not preserve)
- DO NOT ignore contamination
- DO NOT consume if uncertain (better to waste than get sick)
- DO NOT ignore illness after eating → Medical RAG

MYTHS CORRECTED:
- "Any preservation method works" - FALSE: Must use proper methods
- "Spoiled meat is safe if cooked" - FALSE: Do not consume spoiled meat
- "Preservation can wait" - FALSE: Must preserve quickly
- "A little spoilage won't hurt" - FALSE: Spoiled meat can cause severe illness
