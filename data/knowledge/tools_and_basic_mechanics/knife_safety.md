- When working in difficult conditions

IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES:
1. Assess knife condition: Is it safe to use?
2. Assess task requirements: Is knife appropriate for task?
3. Assess your condition: Are you capable of safe knife use?
4. Assess environment: Are conditions safe for knife use?
5. Plan cutting action: Where will blade go if it slips?
6. Maintain awareness: Continuous attention to blade position
7. Use proper technique: Correct method reduces injury risk
8. Have first aid ready: Be prepared for injuries

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Cuts and lacerations: Blade can cut skin, muscle, tendons, arteries
- Severed fingers or digits: Deep cuts can amputate
- Arterial bleeding: Cuts to arteries can cause rapid blood loss
- Infection: Open wounds are infection risks
- Accidental stabbing: Blade can penetrate body if uncontrolled
- Injury to others: Knife can injure people nearby
- Blade breakage: Broken blade can cause injury
- Slippery grip: Wet, oily, or bloody hands cause loss of control
- Fatigue: Tired users make more mistakes
- Distraction: Loss of focus causes accidents

STEP-BY-STEP ACTIONS:

1. INSPECT KNIFE BEFORE USE (DO FIRST):
   - Check blade: Is it sharp? Dull blades are more dangerous
   - Check handle: Is it secure? Loose handle is dangerous
   - Check for damage: Cracks, chips, bends indicate problems
   - Check for rust: Rust weakens blade and causes tetanus risk
   - Check locking mechanism: If folding knife, does lock work?
   - Check blade retention: Is blade securely attached to handle?
   - If knife is damaged: Do not use, find alternative or repair
   - If knife is unsafe: Do not use, safety is priority
   - Do not use damaged knives: They are more dangerous than no knife

2. PREPARE WORK AREA:
   - Clear area: Remove obstacles that could cause accidents
   - Ensure adequate light: You must see what you are cutting
   - Ensure stable surface: Unstable surface causes loss of control
   - Ensure adequate space: Room to work without hitting obstacles
   - Position materials: Secure materials to be cut
   - Position yourself: Stable stance, balanced position
   - Clear path for blade: Where will blade go if it slips?
   - Remove distractions: Focus is essential for safety
   - Have first aid ready: Be prepared for injuries
   - Do not work in cramped or cluttered areas

3. MAINTAIN PROPER GRIP:
   - Grip handle firmly: But not so tight you lose feeling
   - Keep fingers away from blade: Fingers should never be in cutting path
   - Use full handle: Do not grip near blade
   - Keep hand dry: Wet or oily hands cause slippage
   - Keep hand clean: Blood or dirt reduces grip
   - Adjust grip for task: Different tasks require different grips
   - Maintain grip throughout cut: Do not relax during cutting
   - If grip becomes slippery: Stop, clean hands and handle
   - Do not use knife with wet or bloody hands

4. USE PROPER CUTTING TECHNIQUE:
   - Cut away from body: Blade should never point toward you
   - Cut away from others: Ensure no one is in cutting path
   - Use controlled force: Do not use excessive force
   - Use appropriate blade: Right tool for right job
   - Support material being cut: Unsupported material can move
   - Use cutting board or surface: Protects blade and surface
   - Make multiple small cuts: Rather than one large cut
   - Let blade do the work: Sharp blade requires less force
   - Do not force blade: Forcing causes loss of control
   - Do not cut toward yourself: This is extremely dangerous

5. MAINTAIN BLADE AWARENESS:
   - Always know where blade is: Continuous awareness of blade position
   - Always know where blade is going: Plan cutting path
   - Always know what is behind cutting target: What will blade hit if it goes through?
   - Keep blade in sight: Do not cut where you cannot see
   - Use peripheral vision: Watch blade and surroundings
   - Do not cut blindly: You must see what you are cutting
   - Do not cut when distracted: Focus is essential
   - Do not cut when tired: Fatigue causes mistakes
   - Do not cut when rushed: Haste causes accidents

6. HANDLE KNIFE SAFELY WHEN NOT CUTTING:
   - Close folding knives: When not in use, close blade
   - Sheath fixed blades: Use sheath when not cutting
   - Pass knife safely: Handle first, blade away from recipient
   - Store knife safely: Secure location, blade protected
   - Do not carry open knife: Open blade is dangerous
   - Do not leave knife unattended: Others may misuse
   - Do not play with knife: Knives are tools, not toys
   - Do not use knife for inappropriate tasks: Use right tool for job
   - Do not throw knife: Throwing knives is extremely dangerous

7. RESPOND TO PROBLEMS SAFELY:
   - If blade slips: Stop immediately, assess for injury
   - If material moves: Stop, reposition, secure material
   - If grip becomes slippery: Stop, clean hands and handle
   - If blade becomes stuck: Do not force, work blade free carefully
   - If you become distracted: Stop, refocus, then continue
   - If you become tired: Stop, rest, then continue
   - If conditions become unsafe: Stop, address conditions, then continue
   - Do not continue if conditions are unsafe
   - Do not ignore problems: Address immediately

8. MAINTAIN KNIFE PROPERLY:
   - Keep blade sharp: Sharp blade is safer than dull blade
   - Clean knife after use: Prevents rust and maintains function
   - Oil blade if storing: Prevents rust
   - Check handle regularly: Ensure it remains secure
   - Check blade regularly: Ensure it remains intact
   - Repair damage: Fix problems before they worsen
   - Store properly: Dry location, protected blade
   - Do not neglect maintenance: Poor maintenance causes accidents
   - Do not use damaged knife: Repair or replace

FOR SPECIFIC SITUATIONS / CONDITIONS:

USING KNIFE WHEN TIRED:
