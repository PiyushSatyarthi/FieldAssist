- Fractures: Dropped loads or falls can break bones
- Loss of control: Heavy or awkward loads can cause loss of control
- Injury to others: Dropped loads can injure people nearby
- Long-term disability: Back injuries can be permanent

STEP-BY-STEP ACTIONS:

1. ASSESS LOAD (DO FIRST):
   - Estimate weight: Is load within your capability?
   - Check load stability: Is load balanced? Will it shift?
   - Check load shape: Is load awkward? Hard to grip?
   - Check load condition: Is load damaged? Sharp edges?
   - Check load contents: Are contents secure? Will they shift?
   - Check load size: Can you see around load? Can you grip it?
   - If load is too heavy: Do not lift alone, get help
   - If load is unsafe: Do not lift, find alternative
   - Do not lift if you cannot safely handle load

2. ASSESS YOUR CONDITION:
   - Assess strength: Can you lift this load?
   - Assess fatigue: Are you tired? Tired lifting is dangerous
   - Assess injury: Any existing injuries that affect lifting?
   - Assess balance: Can you maintain balance with load?
   - Assess grip: Can you maintain secure grip?
   - Assess vision: Can you see where you are going?
   - If you are not capable: Do not lift, get help or wait
   - If you are exhausted: Do not lift, rest first
   - Do not lift if you are not physically capable

3. PLAN THE LIFT:
   - Plan path: Where are you taking load?
   - Plan route: Clear path? Obstacles? Distance?
   - Plan placement: Where will you set load down?
   - Plan technique: How will you lift? How will you carry?
   - Plan help: Do you need help? Is help available?
   - Plan breaks: Will you need to rest? Where?
   - Plan backup: What if you cannot complete lift?
   - Do not lift without plan: Unplanned lifting is dangerous
   - Do not lift if path is unclear: You must see where you are going

4. PREPARE FOR LIFT:
   - Clear path: Remove obstacles from path
   - Ensure adequate light: You must see obstacles
   - Ensure stable footing: Uneven ground causes falls
   - Position load: Get close to load, position for lift
   - Position yourself: Stable stance, balanced position
   - Get help if needed: Coordinate with helpers
   - Warm up if possible: Light movement prepares muscles
   - Do not lift from awkward position: Position yourself correctly

5. USE PROPER LIFTING TECHNIQUE:
   - Stand close to load: Do not reach for load
   - Feet shoulder-width apart: Stable base
   - Bend knees, not back: Squat down to load
   - Keep back straight: Do not round back
   - Grip load securely: Both hands, firm grip
   - Keep load close to body: Reduces strain on back
   - Lift with legs: Use leg muscles, not back
   - Rise slowly: Controlled lift, do not jerk
   - Keep back straight throughout: Maintain posture
   - Do not twist while lifting: Turn with feet, not back
   - Do not lift with rounded back: Causes back injury

6. CARRY LOAD SAFELY:
   - Keep load close to body: Reduces strain
   - Keep back straight: Maintain posture
   - Take small steps: Maintain balance
   - Watch where you are going: Look ahead, not down
   - Maintain grip: Do not let load slip
   - Rest if needed: Set load down, rest, then continue
   - Do not carry load too far: Distance increases risk
   - Do not carry load too long: Time increases fatigue
   - Do not rush: Haste causes loss of control
   - Do not carry if you cannot see: Visibility is essential

7. SET LOAD DOWN SAFELY:
   - Plan placement: Where will you set load?
   - Lower slowly: Controlled lowering, do not drop
   - Bend knees, not back: Squat down to set load
   - Keep back straight: Maintain posture
   - Set load down gently: Do not drop load
   - Release grip carefully: Do not let load fall
   - Do not drop load: Dropping can cause injury
   - Do not set load down with rounded back: Causes back injury
   - Do not twist while setting down: Turn with feet

8. USE HELP WHEN NEEDED:
   - Recognize when help is needed: Do not be too proud
   - Coordinate with helpers: Communication is essential
   - Use same technique: All lifters use same method
   - Lift together: Synchronized lifting prevents injury
   - Communicate: Count, signals, verbal communication
   - Do not lift alone if load is too heavy: Get help
   - Do not lift with uncoordinated helpers: Coordination is essential
   - Do not ignore need for help: Pride causes injury

9. MANAGE LOADS OVER TIME:
   - Pace yourself: Do not exhaust yourself
   - Take breaks: Rest prevents exhaustion
   - Rotate tasks: Vary activities to prevent overuse
   - Distribute weight: Balance load if carrying multiple items
   - Prioritize loads: Essential items first
   - Do not overexert: Exhaustion causes mistakes and injury
   - Do not ignore fatigue: Rest before continuing
   - Do not lift continuously: Breaks are essential
