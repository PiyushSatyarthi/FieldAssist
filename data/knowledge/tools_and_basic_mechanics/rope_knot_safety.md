WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE:
- Using rope for any purpose
- Tying knots for any application
- Climbing or descending with rope
- Lifting or lowering loads with rope
- Securing items with rope
- Building structures with rope
- When rope failure could cause injury
- When working at height with rope
- When professional rescue is unavailable
- When rope is your primary tool

IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES:
1. Assess rope condition: Is it safe to use?
2. Assess rope strength: Is it strong enough for load?
3. Assess knot appropriateness: Is knot correct for application?
4. Assess your condition: Are you capable of safe rope use?
5. Assess environment: Are conditions safe for rope use?
6. Plan rope use: What could go wrong?
7. Test before committing: Test rope and knots before loading
8. Have backup plan: What if rope or knot fails?

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Rope failure: Rope can break under load, causing falls or dropped loads
- Knot failure: Knots can slip or come untied, causing failure
- Rope burns: Rope moving through hands causes severe burns
- Falls: Rope failure or knot failure can cause falls from height
- Crush injuries: Rope under tension can crush body parts
- Cuts: Rope can cut skin, especially under tension
- Entanglement: Rope can entangle body parts, causing injury
- Shock loading: Sudden loading can break rope or knots
- Abrasion: Rope rubbing against surfaces can weaken or break
- Environmental damage: Sun, water, chemicals can weaken rope

STEP-BY-STEP ACTIONS:

1. INSPECT ROPE BEFORE USE (DO FIRST):
   - Check for damage: Cuts, abrasion, fraying, broken strands
   - Check for wear: Thinning, weak spots, discoloration
   - Check for knots: Existing knots weaken rope
   - Check for chemicals: Chemical damage weakens rope
   - Check for UV damage: Sun damage weakens synthetic rope
   - Check for rot: Rot weakens natural fiber rope
   - Check length: Is rope long enough for task?
   - Check diameter: Is rope appropriate size for load?
   - If rope is damaged: Do not use, find alternative
   - If rope is unsafe: Do not use, safety is priority

2. ASSESS ROPE STRENGTH:
   - Know rope strength: What is working load limit?
   - Calculate load: What weight will rope carry?
   - Use safety margin: Load should be well below breaking strength
   - Consider dynamic loads: Moving loads stress rope more
   - Consider shock loads: Sudden loading can break rope
   - Consider wear: Used rope is weaker than new rope
   - Consider knots: Knots reduce rope strength significantly
   - Consider environment: Wet, cold, or damaged rope is weaker
   - Do not exceed safe working load: Overloading causes failure
   - Do not use rope that is too weak: Insufficient strength is dangerous

3. SELECT APPROPRIATE KNOT:
   - Match knot to application: Right knot for right job
   - Know knot strength: Some knots are stronger than others
   - Know knot security: Some knots hold better than others
   - Know knot behavior: How does knot behave under load?
   - Test knot: Practice knot before using under load
   - Do not use wrong knot: Wrong knot can fail
   - Do not use untested knot: Unknown knots are dangerous
   - Do not use decorative knots for load-bearing: Decorative knots are weak
   - Do not use complex knots if simple works: Complexity increases error risk

4. TIE KNOTS CORRECTLY:
   - Follow knot instructions exactly: Correct tying is essential
   - Check knot after tying: Ensure it is tied correctly
   - Dress knot properly: Arrange rope correctly in knot
   - Set knot: Tighten knot properly before loading
   - Leave adequate tail: Long enough to prevent untying
   - Secure tail if necessary: Prevent tail from untying knot
   - Test knot: Light load test before committing
   - Do not tie knots incorrectly: Incorrect knots fail
   - Do not use knots you do not know: Unknown knots are dangerous
   - Do not rush knot tying: Haste causes mistakes

5. PROTECT ROPE FROM DAMAGE:
   - Protect from abrasion: Rope rubbing against surfaces weakens
   - Protect from sharp edges: Sharp edges can cut rope
   - Use padding: Protect rope at contact points
   - Protect from chemicals: Chemicals weaken rope
   - Protect from UV: Sun damages synthetic rope
   - Protect from water: Water can weaken some ropes
   - Protect from heat: Heat can damage rope
   - Do not drag rope: Dragging causes abrasion
   - Do not step on rope: Can damage rope
   - Do not leave rope in sun: UV damage weakens rope

6. USE ROPE SAFELY:
   - Never stand under suspended loads: Falling loads can kill
   - Never put body parts in rope loops: Can cause crushing
   - Never wrap rope around body: Can cause crushing or entanglement
   - Keep hands away from moving rope: Rope burns are severe
   - Use gloves when handling rope: Protects hands from burns and cuts
   - Work away from rope path: Do not stand where rope could hit you
   - Communicate: If in group, coordinate rope use
   - Do not use rope for inappropriate tasks: Wrong use causes failure
   - Do not exceed safe limits: Overloading causes failure
   - Do not ignore warning signs: Fraying, stretching indicate problems

7. HANDLE ROPE UNDER LOAD:
   - Never release load suddenly: Sudden release causes dangerous movement
   - Lower loads slowly: Controlled lowering prevents shock loading
   - Use mechanical advantage: Pulleys, blocks reduce required force
   - Use proper technique: Correct method prevents injury
   - Maintain control: Always maintain control of rope
   - Use backup: Secondary rope or brake for safety
   - Do not let rope run through hands: Causes severe burns
   - Do not grab rope suddenly: Sudden grabbing causes burns
   - Do not release rope under tension: Can cause dangerous whipping
   - Do not exceed your strength: Get help or use mechanical advantage

8. RESPOND TO PROBLEMS SAFELY:
   - If rope shows damage: Stop using immediately, replace rope
   - If knot slips: Stop, retie knot correctly
   - If rope stretches excessively: May indicate overload, stop and assess
   - If you lose control: Stop, regain control before continuing
   - If conditions become unsafe: Stop, address conditions, then continue
   - Do not continue if rope is damaged: Damaged rope can fail
   - Do not continue if knot is slipping: Slipping knot will fail
   - Do not ignore problems: Address immediately

9. MAINTAIN ROPE PROPERLY:
   - Clean rope after use: Remove dirt, sand, chemicals
   - Dry rope if wet: Wet rope can rot or freeze
   - Store rope properly: Coiled, protected from damage
   - Inspect rope regularly: Check for damage, wear, weakness
   - Repair or replace damaged rope: Do not use damaged rope
   - Protect from environment: Sun, water, chemicals, heat
   - Do not neglect maintenance: Poor maintenance causes failure
   - Do not use damaged rope: Repair or replace
