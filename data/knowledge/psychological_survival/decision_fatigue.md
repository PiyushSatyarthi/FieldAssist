- Break down: Break complex into simple
- Use criteria: Use simple criteria
- Get help: Get help with decisions if in group
- Do not make complex decisions: Complex decisions cause fatigue

VITAL SIGNS TO CHECK:

DECISION LOAD:
- Number: How many decisions required?
- Complexity: How complex are decisions?
- Frequency: How frequent are decisions?
- These signs indicate decision load

DECISION CAPACITY:
- Ability: Can you make decisions?
- Quality: Are decisions good quality?
- Speed: Can you decide quickly?
