   - Do not ignore systems: Systems reduce load
   - Do not reinvent: Use established systems

8. PREVENT RECURRENCE:
   - Identify causes: What causes overload?
   - Avoid causes: Avoid overload causes when possible
   - Prepare systems: Prepare systems before overload
   - Practice management: Practice overload management
   - Do not ignore prevention: Prevention prevents overload
   - Do not ignore causes: Causes create overload

FOR SPECIFIC SITUATIONS:

OVERLOAD FROM TOO MANY DECISIONS:
- Reduce decisions: Make fewer decisions
- Use defaults: Use default choices
- Defer decisions: Defer non-urgent decisions
- Simplify decisions: Make simpler decisions
- Do not make all decisions: All decisions are overwhelming
- Do not ignore reduction: Reduction reduces load

OVERLOAD FROM TOO MUCH INFORMATION:
- Limit information: Take in less information
- Filter information: Filter to essential only
- Process gradually: Process information gradually
- Ignore non-essential: Ignore non-essential information
- Do not process everything: Everything is overwhelming
- Do not ignore filtering: Filtering reduces load

OVERLOAD FROM TOO MANY TASKS:
- Reduce tasks: Do fewer tasks
- Prioritize tasks: Focus on most important
- Defer tasks: Defer non-urgent tasks
- Simplify tasks: Make tasks simpler
- Do not do all tasks: All tasks are overwhelming
- Do not ignore reduction: Reduction reduces load

VITAL SIGNS TO CHECK:

COGNITIVE LOAD:
- Information: How much information processing?
- Decisions: How many decisions required?
- Tasks: How many tasks required?
- These signs indicate cognitive load

MENTAL CAPACITY:
- Clarity: Can you think clearly?
- Focus: Can you focus?
- Processing: Can you process information?
- These signs indicate mental capacity

OVERLOAD SIGNS:
- Confusion: Are you confused?
- Mistakes: Are you making mistakes?

- If severe situation occurs → trigger appropriate RAGs

IMPROVISED OVERLOAD MANAGEMENT:
- Use available techniques: Any techniques help

- Use simplification: Simplification always helps
- Use group: If in group, share load
- Use time: Slower, more controlled processing
