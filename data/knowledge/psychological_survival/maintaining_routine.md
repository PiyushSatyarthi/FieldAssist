FOR SPECIFIC ROUTINES:

DAILY ROUTINE:
- Morning routine: Establish morning routine
- Day routine: Establish day routine
- Evening routine: Establish evening routine
- Do not ignore daily: Daily routine is essential
- Do not skip daily: Skipping breaks routine

SELF-CARE ROUTINE:
- Hygiene routine: Establish hygiene routine
- Health routine: Establish health routine
- Rest routine: Establish rest routine
- Do not ignore self-care: Self-care is essential

VITAL SIGNS TO CHECK:

ROUTINE STATUS:
- Establishment: Is routine established?
- Adherence: Is routine being followed?
- Consistency: Is routine consistent?
- These signs indicate routine status

ROUTINE EFFECTIVENESS:
- Stability: Is routine providing stability?
- Structure: Is routine providing structure?
- Mental health: Is routine maintaining mental health?
- These signs indicate routine effectiveness

DISRUPTION STATUS:
- Disruption: Is routine disrupted?
- Frequency: How often is routine disrupted?
- Recovery: Is routine recovering from disruption?
- These signs indicate disruption status

MAINTENANCE STATUS:
- Maintenance: Is routine being maintained?
- Protection: Is routine being protected?
- Restoration: Is routine being restored?
- These signs indicate maintenance status
