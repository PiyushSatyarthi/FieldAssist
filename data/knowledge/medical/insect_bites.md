TITLE: Insect Bites and Stings

KEYWORDS: insect bite, sting, bee sting, wasp sting, allergic reaction, anaphylaxis, venom

SEVERITY LEVELS:
- Mild: Local pain, redness, minor swelling at bite site
- Serious: Significant swelling, spreading redness, some systemic symptoms
- Life-threatening: Anaphylaxis - difficulty breathing, swelling of face/throat, loss of consciousness

WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE:
- Pain, redness, or swelling after insect bite or sting
- Person stung by bee, wasp, or other stinging insect
- Bite from mosquito, tick, or other biting insect
- Signs of allergic reaction after insect exposure
- Multiple stings

IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES:
1. Preserve life - Anaphylaxis can be fatal
2. Remove stinger if present - Prevents continued venom injection
3. Monitor for allergic reaction - Can develop rapidly
4. Treat symptoms - Reduce pain and swelling

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Anaphylaxis can cause death within minutes
- Multiple stings can cause severe reactions
- Some people have severe allergies
- Time is critical if allergic reaction develops

STEP-BY-STEP TREATMENT:

1. REMOVE STINGER (IF PRESENT):
   - Bees leave stinger - remove immediately
   - Scrape stinger out (do not squeeze)
   - Use fingernail, credit card, or similar
   - Do NOT use tweezers (squeezes more venom in)
   - Remove as quickly as possible

2. WASH THE AREA:
   - Use clean water
   - Remove any remaining stinger parts
   - Clean to prevent infection
   - Do NOT scrub vigorously

3. ASSESS FOR ALLERGIC REACTION:
   - Check for signs of anaphylaxis (see below)
   - Monitor breathing
   - Check for swelling of face/throat
   - Watch for systemic symptoms

4. IF MILD REACTION (LOCAL ONLY):
   - Apply cold compress to reduce swelling
   - Keep area clean and dry
   - Monitor for worsening
   - Pain usually resolves in hours

5. IF ALLERGIC REACTION:
   - See allergic_reactions.md for complete management
   - Anaphylaxis is life-threatening
   - Monitor breathing closely
   - Be prepared for rescue breathing

FOR SPECIFIC WOUND TYPES / SPECIAL CASES:

BEE STING:
- Leaves stinger - remove immediately
- Usually single sting
- Local reaction common
- May cause allergic reaction

WASP/HORNET STING:
- Does not leave stinger
- Can sting multiple times
- Usually more painful
- May cause allergic reaction

MULTIPLE STINGS:
- More venom = more severe reaction
- Monitor closely
- May cause systemic symptoms
- Higher risk of severe reaction

TICK BITE:
- Remove tick carefully (see below)
- Monitor for signs of illness
- May transmit diseases
- Clean bite site

MOSQUITO BITE:
- Usually minor
- May transmit diseases
- Clean to prevent infection
- Monitor for unusual symptoms

VITAL SIGNS TO CHECK:

LOCAL REACTION:
- Pain: Mild to moderate
- Redness: Around bite site
- Swelling: Local to bite site
- Usually resolves in hours to days

ALLERGIC REACTION SIGNS:
- Swelling beyond bite site
- Hives or rash
- Itching all over
- Nausea, vomiting

ANAPHYLAXIS SIGNS (LIFE-THREATENING):
- Difficulty breathing or wheezing
- Swelling of face, lips, tongue, throat
- Rapid pulse, low blood pressure
- Hives or rash
- Loss of consciousness
- See allergic_reactions.md for complete management

BREATHING:
- Normal: No difficulty
- Moderate: Some difficulty
- Severe: Severe difficulty (anaphylaxis)

CONSCIOUSNESS:
- Normal: Alert
- Moderate: Dizzy, weak
- Severe: Loss of consciousness (anaphylaxis)

WHEN PROFESSIONAL HELP IS UNAVAILABLE:

WHAT YOU CAN DO:
- Remove stinger if present
- Clean bite site
- Apply cold compress
- Monitor for allergic reaction
- Most bites resolve without treatment
- Focus on preventing anaphylaxis

REALITY CHECK:
- Anaphylaxis requires epinephrine (may not be available)
- Some people will die from anaphylaxis despite efforts
- Most bites are not life-threatening
- Focus on monitoring and supportive care

LONG-TERM CARE:

IF LOCAL REACTION:
- Usually resolves in hours to days
- Keep clean to prevent infection
- Monitor for infection signs
- See wound_care.md if infection develops

IF ALLERGIC REACTION:
- Monitor for recurrence
- Person should avoid insect if possible
- May need to carry epinephrine if available
- See allergic_reactions.md

PREVENTION:

AVOID INSECTS:
- Avoid areas with many insects
- Use protective clothing
- Avoid perfumes and bright colors (attracts insects)
- Be careful with food and drinks outdoors
- Check for ticks after being outdoors

IF STUNG:
- Move away from area
- Do not swat at insects (increases risk)
- Remove stinger quickly
- Monitor for reaction

REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS:

WITH PROPER CARE:
- Most bites resolve without problems
- Local reactions usually resolve in hours to days
- Proper removal of stinger reduces reaction
- Most people do not have severe allergies

WITHOUT PROFESSIONAL HELP:
- Anaphylaxis requires epinephrine (may not be available)
- Some people will die from anaphylaxis despite efforts
- Most bites are not life-threatening
- Focus on monitoring and supportive care

DO NOT:
- DO NOT scratch the bite (increases infection risk, spreads venom)
- DO NOT apply unknown substances (may cause more harm)
- DO NOT ignore signs of allergic reaction (can be fatal)
- DO NOT squeeze stinger (injects more venom)
- DO NOT use tweezers to remove stinger (squeezes venom in)
- DO NOT ignore difficulty breathing (anaphylaxis sign)

TICK REMOVAL (SPECIFIC):
- Use fine-tipped tweezers if available
- Grasp tick close to skin
- Pull straight out steadily
- Do NOT twist or jerk
- Do NOT squeeze tick body
- Clean bite site after removal
- Monitor for signs of illness
