TITLE: Frostbite and Cold Injury

KEYWORDS: frostbite, cold injury, freezing, hypothermia, cold exposure, tissue damage

SEVERITY LEVELS:
- Mild: Frostnip - numbness, white/pale skin, no permanent damage
- Serious: Superficial frostbite - blisters, tissue damage, may lose skin
- Life-threatening: Deep frostbite - tissue death, may require amputation, risk of hypothermia

WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE:
- Exposure to cold temperatures
- Numbness or loss of sensation in fingers, toes, nose, ears
- White, gray, or waxy-looking skin
- Hard or frozen-feeling skin
- Blisters after rewarming
- Person has been in cold for extended period

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Frostbite can cause permanent tissue damage
- Rewarming incorrectly can cause more damage
- Deep frostbite can lead to amputation
- Person may also have hypothermia (see hypothermia.md)
- Do not rewarm if refreezing is possible (causes more damage)

STEP-BY-STEP ACTIONS (DO THIS IN ORDER):

1. ASSESS FOR HYPOTHERMIA:
   - Frostbite often occurs with hypothermia
   - Check for signs of hypothermia (see hypothermia.md)
   - Treat hypothermia first if present (life-threatening)
   - Do not focus only on frostbite if person is hypothermic

2. REMOVE FROM COLD:
   - Get person to warm, dry shelter immediately
   - Remove wet clothing
   - Protect affected areas from further cold
   - Do not allow affected areas to refreeze

3. REWARMING (IF NO RISK OF REFREEZING):
   - Immerse affected area in warm (not hot) water
   - Temperature should be 98-104°F (37-40°C)
   - Test water temperature with unaffected hand
   - Continue until skin is soft and color returns
   - Usually takes 15-30 minutes
   - Do NOT use hot water (causes burns)
   - Do NOT rub or massage (causes tissue damage)
   - Do NOT use direct heat (fire, heater - causes burns)
   - REWARMING PROCESS:
     * Pain will be severe when rewarming - this is normal
     * Skin may turn red or purple
     * Blisters may form (do not break)
     * Continue rewarming until tissue is soft and pliable
     * Do not stop early - incomplete rewarming causes more damage
   - PREVENTING REFREEZING:
     * Once rewarmed, must stay warm
     * Do not allow affected area to get cold again
     * Protect from any cold exposure
     * Refreezing causes severe damage

4. IF REFREEZING IS POSSIBLE:
   - Do NOT rewarm if person must go back into cold
   - Refreezing causes more damage than leaving frozen
   - Keep area frozen until safe to rewarm
   - Protect from further injury

5. AFTER REWARMING:
   - Blisters may form - do not break
   - Wrap affected area loosely with clean cloth
   - Elevate affected area if possible
   - Keep person warm
   - Pain will be severe - this is normal

6. MONITOR FOR INFECTION:
   - Frostbite increases infection risk
   - Watch for signs of infection (redness, pus, increasing pain)
   - Keep area clean and dry
   - See wound_infection_management.md if infection develops

WHAT NOT TO DO:
- DO NOT rewarm if refreezing is possible
- DO NOT use hot water or direct heat (causes burns)
- DO NOT rub or massage frozen tissue (causes damage)
- DO NOT break blisters
- DO NOT walk on frostbitten feet if avoidable
- DO NOT smoke (reduces blood flow)
- DO NOT give alcohol (increases heat loss)
- DO NOT use snow to rub (causes more damage)

IMPROVISED / LOW-RESOURCE OPTIONS:

NO WARM WATER:
- Use body heat (place affected area against warm skin)
- Use warm (not hot) compresses
- Do NOT use direct heat sources
- Gradual rewarming is better than rapid

NO CLEAN CLOTH:
- Use cleanest available material
- Wrap loosely
- Protect from further injury
- Keep dry

MONITORING:
- Watch for color return
- Monitor for blisters
- Check for sensation return
- Watch for signs of infection

WHEN YOU MUST SEEK PROFESSIONAL HELP:
- Deep frostbite (tissue appears dead, black)
- Large areas affected
- Frostbite with hypothermia
- Signs of infection
- Requires amputation (not available)
- Person may need surgical debridement

REALISTIC OUTCOMES & LIMITATIONS:

WITH PROPER CARE:
- Frostnip resolves without permanent damage
- Superficial frostbite may heal but with scarring
- Proper rewarming reduces tissue loss
- Some function may be lost

WITHOUT PROFESSIONAL HELP:
- Deep frostbite may require amputation (not available)
- Some tissue will die despite best efforts
- Infection risk is high
- Permanent disability is possible

LONG-TERM:
- Affected areas may be permanently sensitive to cold
- Some tissue loss is likely with serious frostbite
- May have ongoing pain
- Protect from future cold exposure

SAFETY & ACCURACY RULES:

MEDICAL REASONING:
- Frostbite is tissue freezing causing cell death
- Rewarming restores blood flow but damaged tissue may not recover
- Refreezing causes more damage than initial freezing
- Rubbing causes mechanical damage to frozen tissue

CLEAN VS DIRTY VS LAST-RESOURCE:
- Clean: Proper medical care, controlled rewarming (ideal but unavailable)
- Dirty: Warm water, clean dressings (acceptable)
- Last-resort: Body heat, whatever available (better than nothing)

MYTHS CORRECTED:
- "Rub with snow" - FALSE: Causes more damage
- "Use hot water" - FALSE: Causes burns
- "Frostbite is not serious" - FALSE: Can cause permanent damage

PREVENTION:
- Dress in layers
- Keep dry
- Protect extremities
- Avoid prolonged cold exposure
- Stay hydrated and fed
- Watch for early signs (numbness, pale skin)
