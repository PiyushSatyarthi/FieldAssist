TITLE: Airway Obstruction and Breathing Emergencies

KEYWORDS: choking, airway obstruction, cannot breathe, Heimlich maneuver, CPR, rescue breathing, asphyxia, respiratory arrest

SEVERITY LEVELS:
- Mild: Coughing, can speak, partial obstruction
- Serious: Cannot speak, weak cough, struggling to breathe
- Life-threatening: Cannot breathe, no sound, blue lips, loss of consciousness

WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE:
- Person cannot breathe or speak
- Choking on food or object
- Person clutching throat (universal choking sign)
- Blue or gray lips/skin (cyanosis)
- Loss of consciousness from breathing problem
- No chest movement or breathing sounds
- Drowning victim pulled from water

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Brain damage begins after 4 minutes without oxygen
- Death occurs within 6-10 minutes of complete airway obstruction
- Time is critical: Act immediately, do not wait
- Secondary risk: Broken ribs from chest compressions (acceptable to save life)

STEP-BY-STEP ACTIONS (DO THIS IN ORDER):

1. ASSESS CONSCIOUSNESS AND BREATHING:
   - Tap shoulder, shout "Are you okay?"
   - Check for breathing: Look for chest movement, listen for breath sounds, feel for air
   - IMPORTANT: Agonal breathing (gasping, irregular) is NOT normal breathing - treat as not breathing
   - Agonal breaths are slow, irregular gasps that occur when heart has stopped - begin CPR immediately
   - Check pulse if trained (carotid artery in neck)
   - If unconscious and not breathing (or only agonal breathing): Go to step 4 (CPR)
   - If conscious but cannot breathe: Go to step 2 (choking)

2. CONSCIOUS PERSON CHOKING (CANNOT SPEAK):
   - Stand behind person
   - Place foot between person's feet for stability
   - Make fist with one hand, thumb side against person's abdomen
   - Place just above navel, below rib cage
   - Grasp fist with other hand
   - Give quick upward thrusts (Heimlich maneuver)
   - Continue until object is expelled or person becomes unconscious
   - If person becomes unconscious: Lower to ground, begin step 4

3. CONSCIOUS PERSON CHOKING (CAN COUGH OR SPEAK):
   - Encourage coughing - do not interfere
   - Stay with person, monitor closely
   - If coughing becomes weak or stops: Begin step 2
   - Do not perform Heimlich on person who can cough effectively

4. UNCONSCIOUS PERSON OR NOT BREATHING:
   - Lower person to firm, flat surface
   - Open airway: Head-tilt chin-lift (unless neck injury suspected)
     * Place one hand on forehead
     * Place fingers of other hand under chin
     * Tilt head back, lift chin
   - If neck injury suspected: Use jaw-thrust only (do not tilt head)
     * Place fingers behind angles of jaw (both sides)
     * Lift jaw forward without tilting head
     * Maintain jaw-thrust while giving breaths
   - Check for visible object in mouth
   - If object visible: Remove with finger sweep (hook finger, do not push deeper)
   - If no object visible: Begin rescue breathing

5. RESCUE BREATHING:
   - Pinch nose closed
   - Seal your mouth over person's mouth (or mouth and nose for infants)
   - Give 2 breaths, each 1 second long
   - Watch for chest to rise
   - If chest does not rise: Reposition head, try again
   - If still no rise: Object may be blocking - attempt to remove

6. CHEST COMPRESSIONS (IF NO PULSE OR UNCONSCIOUS):
   - Position: Kneel beside person, center of chest
   - Hand placement:
     * Adults: Heel of one hand on center of chest, other hand on top
     * Children: One or two hands depending on size
     * Infants: Two fingers on center of chest
   - Compression depth:
     * Adults: 2-2.4 inches (5-6cm)
     * Children: About 2 inches (5cm) or 1/3 chest depth
     * Infants: 1.5 inches (4cm) or 1/3 chest depth
   - Rate: 100-120 compressions per minute
   - Allow full chest recoil between compressions
   - Ratio: 30 compressions to 2 breaths
   - Compression quality is critical:
     * Push hard: At least 2 inches (5cm) for adults
     * Push fast: 100-120 per minute (match song beat like "Stayin' Alive")
     * Allow full recoil: Let chest return completely between compressions
     * Minimize interruptions: Do not stop for more than 10 seconds
   - Continue until: Person responds, help arrives, or you are too exhausted
   - If person shows signs of life (breathing, movement): Stop compressions, monitor
   - If no response after 2 minutes: Continue CPR, consider switching rescuers if available

7. INFANT CHOKING (UNDER 1 YEAR):
   - Hold infant face down on your forearm, support head and neck
   - Head lower than body
   - Give 5 back blows between shoulder blades
   - Turn infant over, support head
   - Give 5 chest thrusts (2 fingers, center of chest, just below nipple line)
   - Repeat until object expelled or infant becomes unconscious
   - If unconscious: Begin infant CPR (see child_emergency_care.md)

WHAT NOT TO DO:
- DO NOT perform Heimlich on person who can cough or speak
- DO NOT give water to choking person (can make obstruction worse)
- DO NOT perform finger sweep blindly (may push object deeper)
- DO NOT tilt head if neck injury suspected (use jaw-thrust only)
- DO NOT stop CPR too early (continue until help arrives or person responds)
- DO NOT give rescue breaths if you cannot get chest to rise (focus on compressions)
- DO NOT delay - every second counts
- DO NOT attempt to remove object if person is breathing (let them cough)

IMPROVISED / LOW-RESOURCE OPTIONS:

NO TRAINING IN CPR:
- Chest compressions alone are better than nothing
- Push hard and fast in center of chest
- Continue until help arrives or person responds
- Even untrained compressions can maintain some circulation

MOUTH-TO-MOUTH CONCERNS:
- If unwilling/unable to give rescue breaths: Compression-only CPR is acceptable
- Focus on high-quality chest compressions
- Compression-only CPR can be effective for first few minutes

POSITIONING WITHOUT EQUIPMENT:
- Use firm ground, floor, or board
- Remove person from soft surfaces (bed, couch) if possible
- If on bed: Place board under person or move to floor

WHEN YOU MUST SEEK PROFESSIONAL HELP:
- Person does not respond after 2 minutes of CPR
- Object cannot be removed and person remains unconscious
- Person regains consciousness but has difficulty breathing
- Signs of injury from rescue attempts (broken ribs are common and acceptable)
- Person requires advanced airway management (not available in austere settings)

REALISTIC OUTCOMES & LIMITATIONS:

WITH PROPER CARE:
- Most choking incidents resolve with Heimlich maneuver
- CPR can maintain circulation for limited time (minutes, not hours)
- Success rate decreases significantly after 10 minutes without oxygen
- Even successful CPR may result in brain damage from oxygen deprivation

WITHOUT PROFESSIONAL HELP:
- Advanced airway management (intubation) not available
- Some obstructions may require surgical removal
- Prolonged CPR without advanced life support has poor outcomes
- Person may survive but with permanent brain damage

LONG-TERM:
- If person survives: Monitor for complications
- Watch for signs of aspiration pneumonia
- May require ongoing respiratory support
- Recovery depends on duration of oxygen deprivation

SAFETY & ACCURACY RULES:

MEDICAL REASONING:
- Heimlich maneuver increases pressure in chest, forcing object out
- Head-tilt chin-lift opens airway by moving tongue away from back of throat
- Chest compressions maintain circulation when heart has stopped
- Rescue breathing provides oxygen when person cannot breathe

CLEAN VS DIRTY VS LAST-RESORT:
- Clean: Use barrier device for rescue breathing (ideal but often unavailable)
- Dirty: Direct mouth-to-mouth (acceptable - disease transmission risk is low compared to death)
- Last-resort: Compression-only CPR if unable/unwilling to give breaths

MYTHS CORRECTED:
- "Water helps dislodge object" - FALSE: Can make obstruction worse
- "Turn person upside down" - Ineffective and dangerous
- "CPR always works" - Reality: Success rates are low, especially without advanced care

CONTRAINDICATIONS:
- Do not tilt head if neck injury suspected (use jaw-thrust)
- Do not perform Heimlich on infants (use back blows and chest thrusts)
- Do not give anything by mouth to unconscious person (aspiration risk)

SPECIAL SITUATIONS:
- Pregnant person: Place hands higher on chest, not abdomen (above uterus)
- Large person: May need to perform from side or use different technique
- Alone and choking: Use chair or railing to perform self-Heimlich (not ideal but may work)
- Recovery position (if breathing but unconscious):
  * Place person on side
  * Lower arm under head
  * Upper leg bent to prevent rolling
  * Head tilted to keep airway open
  * Use this position to prevent choking on vomit
