TITLE: Diarrhea Management

KEYWORDS: diarrhea, dysentery, loose stools, ORS, oral rehydration, WHO IMCI, dehydration prevention

SEVERITY LEVELS:
- Mild: 3-5 loose stools per day, person alert, can drink
- Serious: 6-10 loose stools per day, some weakness, difficulty keeping up with fluids
- Life-threatening: 10+ loose stools per day, severe dehydration, cannot drink, loss of consciousness

WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE:
- Loose or watery stools 3+ times per day
- Person with diarrhea and signs of dehydration
- Bloody diarrhea (dysentery)
- Diarrhea lasting more than 1 day
- Diarrhea in children (especially dangerous)
- Person cannot keep up with fluid losses

IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES:
1. Preserve life - Dehydration is the main killer
2. Begin rehydration immediately - Do not wait
3. Continue nutrition - Body needs energy
4. Monitor closely - Children deteriorate faster

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Dehydration can kill within days
- Children dehydrate faster than adults
- Severe dehydration causes shock and organ failure
- Time is critical - begin rehydration at first sign
- Diarrhea is most common cause of death in survival situations

STEP-BY-STEP TREATMENT:

1. ASSESS SEVERITY:
   - Count stools per day
   - Check for blood in stool
   - Check for signs of dehydration (see dehydration.md)
   - Check consciousness level
   - Determine if mild, serious, or life-threatening

2. START REHYDRATION IMMEDIATELY:
   - This is the #1 priority
   - Begin Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) at first sign
   - Do NOT wait for dehydration to develop
   - Continue ORS even while diarrhea continues

3. ORAL REHYDRATION SOLUTION (ORS):
   - If packets available: Use according to instructions (WHO standard)
   - Homemade recipe (WHO-approved):
     * 1 liter CLEAN water
     * 6 level teaspoons sugar
     * 1/2 level teaspoon salt
     * Mix until dissolved
   - Give after EVERY loose stool
   - Continue until diarrhea stops and person is well
   - No maximum - give as needed

4. CONTINUE NUTRITION:
   - Do NOT stop eating
   - Light, easy-to-digest foods
   - Small, frequent meals
   - Body needs calories to fight infection
   - Fasting makes diarrhea worse

5. MONITOR CLOSELY:
   - Watch for signs of dehydration
   - Check urine output
   - Monitor consciousness
   - Watch for worsening

FOR SPECIFIC WOUND TYPES / SPECIAL CASES:

WATERY DIARRHEA:
- Most common type
- Usually viral or bacterial
- Main risk: Dehydration
- Usually resolves in 3-7 days
- Continue ORS and nutrition

BLOODY DIARRHEA (DYSENTERY):
- Blood or mucus in stool
- Usually bacterial (shigella, E. coli)
- More serious - indicates infection
- Higher risk of complications
- Continue ORS and rest
- May need antibiotics (not available)

DIARRHEA WITH VOMITING:
- Give very small amounts of ORS frequently
- Wait 10 minutes after vomiting, then resume
- Continue despite vomiting
- Some fluid will be absorbed
- See food_poisoning.md if suspected

DIARRHEA WITH FEVER:
- Treat fever (see fever.md)
- Increase fluid intake (fever increases needs)
- Continue ORS
- May indicate more serious infection

DIARRHEA IN CHILDREN:
- Children dehydrate faster than adults
- More vulnerable - monitor closely
- Use ORS (WHO IMCI standard)
- Watch for: No tears when crying, sunken fontanelle (infants)
- See child_emergency_care.md for pediatric specifics

DIARRHEA IN ELDERLY:
- Elderly are more vulnerable
- May not recognize thirst
- Monitor closely
- Begin rehydration at first signs

VITAL SIGNS TO CHECK:

STOOL FREQUENCY:
- Mild: 3-5 per day
- Serious: 6-10 per day
- Life-threatening: 10+ per day

STOOL CHARACTER:
- Watery: Most common, dehydration risk
- Bloody: Dysentery, more serious
- Mucus: May indicate infection

URINE OUTPUT:
- Normal: Every 2-4 hours, light yellow
- Dehydration: Less frequent, dark yellow
- Severe: No urination 8+ hours

SIGNS OF DEHYDRATION:
- Thirst (or loss of thirst - bad sign)
- Dry mouth and skin
- Sunken eyes
- Sunken fontanelle (infants)
- No tears when crying (children)
- Rapid pulse
- Rapid breathing
- Confusion or loss of consciousness
- See dehydration.md for complete assessment

CONSCIOUSNESS:
- Alert: Good
- Dizzy, weak: Moderate dehydration
- Confused, irritable: Severe dehydration
- Unconscious: Life-threatening

WHEN PROFESSIONAL HELP IS UNAVAILABLE:

WHAT YOU CAN DO:
- Continue ORS and rest
- Monitor closely
- Most cases resolve on their own
- Some may need antibiotics that are not available
- Focus on preventing dehydration

REALITY CHECK:
- Most diarrhea resolves in 3-7 days with rehydration
- Some cases may last longer
- Without antibiotics, some bacterial infections may not resolve
- Dehydration is the main killer - prevent it
- Some people will die despite best efforts
- Prevention is always better

LONG-TERM CARE:

IF DIARRHEA LASTS WEEKS:
- May indicate chronic problem
- Continue rehydration
- Try to identify cause (food, water, etc.)
- May need to change diet
- Some may not resolve without medical care

RECOVERY:
- Most resolve in 3-7 days
- Continue adequate hydration during recovery
- Gradually return to normal diet
- Monitor for complications

PREVENTION:

WATER SAFETY:
- Boil water if possible (1 minute rolling boil)
- Filter water through clean cloth
- Store water in clean containers
- Do NOT drink from unknown sources

FOOD SAFETY:
- Cook food thoroughly
- Eat freshly cooked food
- Avoid raw or undercooked meat
- Wash hands before eating
- Store food properly
- Avoid spoiled food

HYGIENE:
- Wash hands with soap and water
- Wash hands after using toilet
- Wash hands before handling food
- Keep cooking areas clean
- Dispose of waste properly

SANITATION:
- Use latrines or dig holes for waste
- Keep waste away from water sources
- Keep waste away from living areas
- Cover waste with soil

REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS:

WITH PROPER CARE:
- Most diarrhea resolves in 3-7 days with rehydration
- Proper ORS use prevents most deaths
- Most people recover fully
- Nutrition helps recovery

WITHOUT PROFESSIONAL HELP:
- Some cases may last longer
- Without antibiotics, some bacterial infections may not resolve
- Dehydration is the main killer - prevent it
- Some people will die despite best efforts
- Prevention is always better

CHILDREN:
- More vulnerable - deteriorate faster
- Require more frequent monitoring
- Higher risk of complications
- ORS is life-saving

DO NOT:
- DO NOT stop fluids to "rest the stomach" (WRONG - causes dehydration)
- DO NOT use anti-diarrheal medicines without knowing cause (can trap infection)
- DO NOT ignore bloody diarrhea
- DO NOT stop eating
- DO NOT give alcohol or caffeine
- DO NOT wait for severe dehydration before starting ORS
- DO NOT ignore early signs of dehydration
- DO NOT stop ORS when diarrhea continues (continue until well)
