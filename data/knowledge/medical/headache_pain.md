IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES:
1. Identify cause - Pain may indicate serious problem

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Severe headache with stiff neck and fever may indicate meningitis (brain infection) - life-threatening
- Pain may indicate serious underlying problem
- Overuse of pain medicines can cause harm
- Some pain requires immediate attention

STEP-BY-STEP TREATMENT:

1. ASSESS THE PAIN:
   - Identify location and type

   - Do NOT combine multiple pain medicines

5. MONITOR CLOSELY:
