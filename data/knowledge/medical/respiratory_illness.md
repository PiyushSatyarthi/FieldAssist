TITLE: Respiratory Illness and Breathing Problems

KEYWORDS: respiratory illness, pneumonia, bronchitis, difficulty breathing, cough, chest infection, shortness of breath

SEVERITY LEVELS:
- Mild: Cough, mild difficulty breathing with activity, no fever
- Serious: Persistent cough, difficulty breathing at rest, fever, chest pain
- Life-threatening: Severe difficulty breathing, cannot speak, blue lips, loss of consciousness

WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE:
- Persistent cough lasting more than a week
- Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath
- Chest pain with breathing
- Fever with cough
- Rapid breathing
- Blue or gray lips/skin (cyanosis)
- Person cannot complete sentences due to breathlessness

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Severe respiratory illness can cause respiratory failure
- Pneumonia can be fatal, especially in elderly or immunocompromised
- Difficulty breathing can worsen rapidly
- Time is critical if breathing is severely compromised

STEP-BY-STEP ACTIONS (DO THIS IN ORDER):

1. ASSESS BREATHING:
   - Count breaths per minute (normal: 12-20 for adults, higher for children)
   - Check if person can speak in full sentences
   - Look for signs of difficulty: Rapid breathing, use of accessory muscles, blue lips
   - Check for fever (see fever.md)
   - Listen for wheezing or abnormal sounds

2. POSITION FOR BREATHING:
   - Keep person sitting up or semi-sitting
   - Lying flat makes breathing more difficult
   - Support person in comfortable position
   - Allow person to find position of comfort

3. MONITOR CLOSELY:
   - Watch for worsening breathing
   - Check temperature regularly
   - Monitor for signs of severe illness
   - Watch for dehydration (see dehydration.md)

4. HYDRATION:
   - Respiratory illness increases fluid needs
   - Keep person well-hydrated
   - Warm fluids may help with cough
   - Small sips frequently
   - Do NOT force fluids if person cannot swallow

5. REST:
   - Minimize physical activity
   - Body needs energy to fight infection
   - Rest helps recovery
   - Avoid exertion

6. FEVER MANAGEMENT:
   - If fever present: Manage according to fever.md
   - Fever with respiratory illness may indicate pneumonia
   - Monitor temperature closely

7. COUGH MANAGEMENT:
   - Productive cough (with phlegm) is helpful - do not suppress
   - Dry cough may be helped by hydration
   - Position person to help clear secretions
   - Do NOT give cough suppressants if productive cough
   - POSTURAL DRAINAGE (IF SAFE):
     * Position person to help drain secretions
     * For lower lung: Lie on side with affected side up, head lower
     * For upper lung: Sit leaning forward
     * Use only if person can tolerate position
     * Do NOT use if person has difficulty breathing
   - RECOGNIZING RESPIRATORY FAILURE:
     * Severe difficulty breathing
     * Cannot speak in full sentences
     * Blue or gray lips/skin (cyanosis)
     * Rapid breathing that is ineffective
     * Confusion or loss of consciousness
     * This is life-threatening - monitor very closely

WHAT NOT TO DO:
- DO NOT lay person flat if having difficulty breathing
- DO NOT give cough suppressants for productive cough
- DO NOT ignore worsening breathing
- DO NOT stop hydration
- DO NOT ignore high fever with respiratory illness
- DO NOT give unknown medicines
- DO NOT smoke or allow smoking near person

IMPROVISED / LOW-RESOURCE OPTIONS:

NO MEDICINES:
- Focus on positioning and hydration
- Rest is primary treatment
- Steam may help (if safe to create)
- Monitor closely

NO OXYGEN:
- Positioning is critical (sitting up)
- Rest to reduce oxygen demand
- Monitor for worsening
- Be prepared for respiratory failure

STEAM (IF SAFE):
- May help with cough and congestion
- Use caution with heat sources
- Do not use if person has difficulty breathing (can worsen)

MONITORING WITHOUT EQUIPMENT:
- Count breaths by watching chest
- Check if person can speak
- Watch for blue lips/skin
- Monitor level of consciousness

WHEN YOU MUST SEEK PROFESSIONAL HELP:
- Severe difficulty breathing (cannot speak, blue lips)
- Person loses consciousness
- High fever with respiratory illness (pneumonia)
- Rapid breathing that worsens
- Signs of respiratory failure
- Requires oxygen or advanced support (not available)
- Person may need antibiotics (not available)

REALISTIC OUTCOMES & LIMITATIONS:

WITH PROPER CARE:
- Most respiratory illnesses resolve in 1-2 weeks
- Rest and hydration help recovery
- Mild cases usually recover fully

WITHOUT PROFESSIONAL HELP:
- Pneumonia can be fatal without antibiotics
- Severe respiratory illness may require oxygen (not available)
- Some infections may not resolve
- Person may die despite best efforts

LONG-TERM:
- Recovery may take weeks
- Some people have persistent cough
- Monitor for complications
- May have reduced lung function

SAFETY & ACCURACY RULES:

MEDICAL REASONING:
- Respiratory illness can be viral or bacterial
- Pneumonia is infection of lung tissue
- Difficulty breathing indicates reduced oxygen exchange
- Positioning helps by reducing pressure on lungs

CLEAN VS DIRTY VS LAST-RESORT:
- Clean: Proper medicines, oxygen, monitoring (ideal but unavailable)
- Dirty: Positioning, hydration, rest (acceptable)
- Last-resort: Focus on comfort, monitor for respiratory failure

MYTHS CORRECTED:
- "Cough suppressants always help" - FALSE: Productive cough should not be suppressed
- "Lying down is best" - FALSE: Sitting up helps breathing
- "All respiratory illness is the same" - FALSE: Severity varies greatly

TYPES OF RESPIRATORY ILLNESS:

BRONCHITIS:
- Inflammation of airways
- Productive cough
- Usually resolves in 1-2 weeks
- Rest and hydration

PNEUMONIA:
- Infection of lung tissue
- Fever, cough, difficulty breathing
- Can be fatal
- Requires antibiotics ideally (may not be available)

COMMON COLD:
- Mild respiratory illness
- Runny nose, cough, mild fever
- Usually resolves in 1 week
- Rest and hydration

PREVENTION:
- Avoid close contact with sick people
- Wash hands regularly
- Cover coughs and sneezes
- Stay warm and dry
- Good nutrition
