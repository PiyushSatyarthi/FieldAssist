TITLE: Massive Bleeding Control

KEYWORDS: hemorrhage, bleeding, blood loss, tourniquet, direct pressure, arterial bleeding, amputation, shock, exsanguination

SEVERITY LEVELS:
- Mild: Dripping, stops with light pressure
- Serious: Steady flow, requires direct pressure
- Life-threatening: Spurting, massive loss, cannot control, person losing consciousness

WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE:
- Active bleeding that does not stop with light pressure
- Blood soaking through dressings quickly
- Spurting or pulsing blood (arterial bleeding)
- Large wounds with visible blood loss
- Amputations or partial amputations
- Person showing signs of blood loss (pale, weak, confused)

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Exsanguination (bleeding to death) can occur in minutes with arterial bleeding
- Loss of 20% blood volume causes shock; 40% is usually fatal
- Uncontrolled bleeding is the leading cause of preventable death in trauma
- Time is critical: Act within seconds, not minutes
- Secondary risk: Infection from contaminated materials (acceptable trade-off to save life)

STEP-BY-STEP ACTIONS (DO THIS IN ORDER):

1. ASSESS AND PRIORITIZE:
   - Check if person is conscious and breathing
   - If unconscious and not breathing: Start airway/breathing care first (see airway_obstruction.md)
   - Identify bleeding location and severity
   - Look for embedded objects (DO NOT remove)
   - Check for multiple bleeding sites

2. APPLY DIRECT PRESSURE (PRIMARY METHOD):
   - Use cleanest available material (cloth, clothing, bandage, your hand)
   - In austere conditions: Use whatever is available - stopping bleeding takes priority over sterility
   - Place material directly on wound
   - Apply firm, constant pressure with palm or heel of hand
   - Maintain pressure for minimum 15 minutes without releasing
   - DO NOT lift to check - this disrupts clot formation
   - If blood soaks through: Add another layer ON TOP, do not remove first layer
   - Continue pressure even if person complains of pain

3. ELEVATE INJURED LIMB (IF APPLICABLE):
   - Raise limb above heart level while maintaining direct pressure
   - Reduces arterial pressure to the area
   - Effective for arm and leg injuries
   - Do not elevate if fracture suspected (immobilize first)

4. USE PRESSURE POINTS (IF DIRECT PRESSURE FAILS):
   - Compress major artery supplying the bleeding area
   - Arm bleeding: Brachial artery (inside upper arm, between bicep and tricep, press against humerus)
   - Leg bleeding: Femoral artery (groin crease, press against pelvic bone)
   - Use fingers or heel of hand to compress artery against underlying bone
   - Maintain compression while continuing direct pressure on wound
   - Warning: This cuts off blood supply to entire limb - use only if necessary
   - Release gradually once bleeding controlled

5. APPLY TOURNIQUET (LIFE-THREATENING BLEEDING ONLY):
   - Indications:
     * Spurting arterial bleeding
     * Direct pressure fails after 15+ minutes
     * Multiple wounds cannot be controlled
     * Person losing consciousness from blood loss
     * Amputation or near-amputation
   - Placement:
     * 2-3 inches (5-7cm) above wound, closer to body
     * NEVER on joint (elbow, knee, wrist, ankle)
     * Use widest material available (minimum 2 inches/5cm wide)
     * Narrow materials (wire, cord) cause tissue damage
   - Application:
     * Wrap around limb twice
     * Tie half-knot
     * Place rigid object (stick, rod, tool) on knot
     * Tie another knot over object
     * Twist object to tighten until bleeding stops
     * Secure object so it cannot untwist
   - Marking:
     * Write "T" and time of application on person's forehead or visible location
     * Use permanent marker, blood, or anything visible
   - DO NOT REMOVE once applied unless:
     * Professional medical help available within 1-2 hours
     * Person is in safe medical facility
   - Reality: Limb may be lost, but life is saved

6. MONITOR FOR SHOCK:
   - Signs: Pale/cold skin, rapid weak pulse, rapid breathing, confusion, loss of consciousness
   - Keep person lying down
   - Elevate legs 12 inches (30cm) if no head/neck/spine injury
   - Keep warm (cover unburned areas)
   - Do not give food or water if severe (may need surgery)
   - See shock.md for complete management

WHAT NOT TO DO:
- DO NOT remove embedded objects (stabilize in place)
- DO NOT use narrow materials for tourniquet (causes tissue damage)
- DO NOT release pressure to check bleeding (maintain 15+ minutes minimum)
- DO NOT remove tourniquet once applied (unless in medical facility)
- DO NOT give alcohol (increases bleeding, worsens shock)
- DO NOT give aspirin or blood thinners
- DO NOT try to "clean out" deep wounds while actively bleeding
- DO NOT elevate legs if head/neck/spine injury suspected
- DO NOT use tourniquet on neck (compressible dressing only)

FOR SPECIFIC WOUND TYPES / SPECIAL CASES:

HEAD WOUNDS:
- Scalp bleeds heavily but is rarely fatal from bleeding alone
- Apply direct pressure with clean cloth
- Do NOT remove objects stuck in head
- Watch for signs of brain injury (confusion, unequal pupils, clear fluid from nose/ears)
- Monitor consciousness closely

NECK WOUNDS (JUNCTIONAL BLEEDING):
- EXTREMELY DANGEROUS - can cut major arteries
- Apply direct pressure but be careful not to compress airway
- Do NOT use tourniquet on neck
- Keep person still and calm
- Monitor breathing closely
- May need to pack wound if deep (advanced technique, high risk)

CHEST WOUNDS:
- If air is being sucked into wound (sucking chest wound):
  * Cover with airtight material (plastic, foil, clothing)
  * Tape or tie on three sides only - allows air to escape but not enter
- Apply pressure around edges, not directly on wound if object is stuck
- Watch for difficulty breathing
- See chest_injuries.md for complete management

ABDOMINAL WOUNDS:
- Do NOT push organs back inside
- Cover with clean, moist cloth
- Keep person lying down with knees bent
- Do NOT give food or water
- Watch for signs of internal bleeding (swollen belly, pale skin, rapid pulse)
- Internal bleeding cannot be controlled externally

AMPUTATIONS:
- Control bleeding with tourniquet if needed
- Save the amputated part if possible (wrap in clean cloth, keep cool but not frozen)
- Elevate stump
- Apply direct pressure to stump
- Do NOT attempt to reattach (requires surgery)

INTERNAL BLEEDING RECOGNITION:
- Signs: Swollen abdomen, pale skin, rapid weak pulse, rapid breathing, confusion
- Cannot be controlled externally
- Monitor for shock
- Keep person still and calm
- Do NOT give fluids if severe (may need surgery)
- See shock.md for management

WOUND PACKING (ADVANCED - FOR DEEP WOUNDS):
- Only if direct pressure fails and wound is deep
- Pack wound with clean cloth or gauze
- Pack firmly but do not overpack
- Maintain pressure over packed wound
- High infection risk - use only if life-threatening bleeding
- Requires training - risky if done incorrectly

NO CLEAN MATERIALS:
- Use cleanest available: Shirt, pants, bandana, torn clothing
- If nothing clean: Use whatever stops bleeding - infection is secondary concern
- Boil cloth if possible, then let cool
- Hold over flame briefly to reduce bacteria (do not burn)

NO BANDAGES:
- Tear clothing into strips
- Use belts, shoelaces, paracord (for tourniquet only if wide enough)
- Wrap tightly and tie securely
- Multiple layers if needed

NO TOURNIQUET MATERIAL:
- Use belt (folded to increase width)
- Multiple layers of cloth tied together
- Torn clothing strips braided together
- Anything 2+ inches wide and strong enough

PRESSURE DRESSING:
- Place pad directly on wound
- Wrap firmly with cloth strips
- Tie securely but not so tight it cuts off circulation
- Check fingers/toes for color and warmth

WHEN YOU MUST SEEK PROFESSIONAL HELP:
- Bleeding cannot be controlled after all methods attempted
- Person loses consciousness or becomes unresponsive
- Signs of severe shock persist despite control of bleeding
- Embedded object in critical location (neck, chest, abdomen)
- Suspected internal bleeding (swollen abdomen, blood from orifices)
- Multiple severe wounds
- Bleeding from head with signs of brain injury

REALISTIC OUTCOMES & LIMITATIONS:

WITH PROPER CARE:
- Most bleeding can be controlled with direct pressure and elevation
- Tourniquets are highly effective but may result in limb loss
- Person may survive but require blood transfusion (not available in austere settings)
- Some will develop shock requiring IV fluids (not available)

WITHOUT PROFESSIONAL HELP:
- Severe arterial bleeding may not stop without surgical intervention
- Person may die from blood loss despite best efforts
- Tourniquet application may save life but cost a limb
- Some wounds may require suturing that cannot be done safely without training
- Infection risk increases with improvised materials (acceptable trade-off)

LONG-TERM:
- Once bleeding controlled, wound requires proper cleaning and care (see wound_care.md)
- Monitor for signs of infection
- Person needs rest and adequate nutrition to recover
- May take weeks to months for full recovery

SAFETY & ACCURACY RULES:

MEDICAL REASONING:
- Direct pressure works by promoting clot formation - requires time and consistency
- Elevation reduces hydrostatic pressure, decreasing blood flow
- Pressure points compress arteries, but also cut off circulation to healthy tissue
- Tourniquets are last resort because they cause tissue death, but prevent exsanguination

CLEAN VS DIRTY VS LAST-RESORT:
- Clean: Sterilized materials, proper bandages (ideal but often unavailable)
- Dirty: Unsterilized but relatively clean materials (acceptable if nothing better)
- Last-resort: Obviously contaminated materials (use only if death is imminent - infection treatable later, bleeding is not)

MYTHS CORRECTED:
- "Urine is sterile" - FALSE: Urine contains bacteria and should not be used on wounds
- "Sucking venom from snake bites" - Not applicable to bleeding, but similar dangerous myths exist
- "Butter on burns" - Not applicable here, but shows importance of evidence-based care

WHEN PROFESSIONAL HELP IS UNAVAILABLE:
- You may need to make difficult decisions
- Tourniquet use may be necessary even knowing limb will be lost
- Some wounds may require stitching - this is advanced and risky without training
- Focus on stopping bleeding, preventing infection, and keeping person alive
- Accept that some outcomes may not be ideal
