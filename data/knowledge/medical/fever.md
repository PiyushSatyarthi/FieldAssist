TITLE: Fever Management

KEYWORDS: fever, high temperature, hyperthermia, infection, febrile seizure, body temperature

SEVERITY LEVELS:
- Mild: 100.4-101°F (38-38.3°C), person alert and comfortable
- Serious: 102-104°F (38.9-40°C), person uncomfortable, may have chills
- Life-threatening: Above 104°F (40°C), confusion, seizures, risk of brain damage

WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE:
- Body temperature above normal (98.6°F / 37°C)
- Person feels hot to touch
- Shivering with hot skin (fever rising)
- Sweating with hot skin (fever breaking)
- Fever with other symptoms (infection, dehydration)
- Fever lasting more than 3 days
- Fever in infants or elderly

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Temperatures above 104°F (40°C) can cause brain damage
- Fever with stiff neck and headache may indicate meningitis (brain infection)
- High fever can cause seizures, especially in children
- Fever increases fluid needs - dehydration risk
- Fever may indicate serious underlying infection

STEP-BY-STEP ACTIONS (DO THIS IN ORDER):

1. MEASURE TEMPERATURE (IF POSSIBLE):
   - Normal: 98.6°F (37°C)
   - Mild fever: 100.4-101°F (38-38.3°C)
   - Moderate: 101-103°F (38.3-39.4°C)
   - High: 103-104°F (39.4-40°C)
   - Very high: Above 104°F (40°C) - dangerous
   - Without thermometer: Feel forehead, compare to your own

2. COOL THE PERSON (IF TEMPERATURE ABOVE 102°F / 38.9°C):
   - Remove excess clothing
   - Use cool (not cold) water on forehead, neck, armpits, groin
   - Wet cloth compresses on these areas (major blood vessels)
   - Fan the person if possible
   - Do NOT use ice or very cold water (causes shivering, raises temperature)
   - Shivering indicates cooling too fast - slow down

3. HYDRATION (CRITICAL):
   - Fever increases fluid needs significantly
   - Person needs to drink fluids constantly
   - Small sips frequently (every 10-15 minutes)
   - Water is best
   - If available: Broth, herbal tea (cooled), oral rehydration solution
   - Do NOT give alcohol or caffeine (dehydrates)
   - Monitor urine output (should urinate every 4-6 hours)

4. REST:
   - Keep person in cool, quiet place
   - Minimize activity
   - Body needs energy to fight infection
   - Rest helps recovery

5. MONITOR CLOSELY:
   - Check temperature regularly if thermometer available
   - Watch for worsening symptoms
   - Monitor breathing and consciousness
   - Watch for signs of serious illness (see below)

6. TREAT UNDERLYING CAUSE IF IDENTIFIABLE:
   - Wound infection: Clean and care for wound (see wound_infection_management.md)
   - Dehydration: Begin rehydration (see dehydration.md)
   - Respiratory infection: See respiratory_illness.md
   - Unknown cause: Focus on fever management and monitoring

WHAT NOT TO DO:
- DO NOT use ice baths or very cold water (dangerous, causes shivering)
- DO NOT overdress person (traps heat)
- DO NOT give alcohol (dehydrates, dangerous)
- DO NOT ignore high fevers (above 104°F / 40°C)
- DO NOT stop hydration
- DO NOT use unknown medicines or plants
- DO NOT bundle person up to "sweat out" fever (dangerous)

IMPROVISED / LOW-RESOURCE OPTIONS:

NO THERMOMETER:
- Use hand to feel temperature (back of hand on forehead)
- Compare to your own temperature
- Watch for shivering (fever rising) vs sweating (fever breaking)
- Monitor person's behavior and alertness

NO RUNNING WATER:
- Use stored water (rainwater, boiled and cooled water)
- Wet cloths and re-wet as they warm
- Place wet cloths on major blood vessels (neck, armpits, groin)
- Evaporation cools the body

IMPROVISED COOLING:
- Wet clothing (if person can tolerate)
- Fan with hand, paper, or cloth
- Shade and ventilation
- Cool ground or floor if available
- Do NOT submerge in cold water (dangerous shock)

MEDICINES (IF AVAILABLE):
- Paracetamol (acetaminophen): Reduces fever and pain, safer for stomach
- Ibuprofen: Reduces fever, pain, inflammation (avoid if stomach problems or dehydrated)
- Do NOT combine multiple fever medicines
- Do NOT give aspirin to children (Reye's syndrome risk)
- See common_medicines.md for dosages

WHEN YOU MUST SEEK PROFESSIONAL HELP:
- Temperature above 104°F (40°C) that does not respond to cooling
- Fever with stiff neck and severe headache (meningitis sign)
- Fever with difficulty breathing
- Fever with seizures
- Fever with severe confusion or loss of consciousness
- Fever in infants under 3 months
- Fever lasting more than 5 days
- Fever that keeps rising despite treatment

REALISTIC OUTCOMES & LIMITATIONS:

WITH PROPER CARE:
- Most fevers resolve in 2-3 days
- Proper cooling and hydration help recovery
- Fever is often body's way of fighting infection
- Most fevers are not dangerous if managed properly

WITHOUT PROFESSIONAL HELP:
- Some fevers indicate serious infections requiring antibiotics (not available)
- High fevers can cause permanent brain damage
- Some infections may not resolve without medical treatment
- Person may die from underlying infection despite fever management

LONG-TERM:
- Recovery depends on underlying cause
- May take days to weeks for full recovery
- Some people have persistent low-grade fevers
- Monitor for complications

SAFETY & ACCURACY RULES:

MEDICAL REASONING:
- Fever is body's natural response to infection (helps kill some bacteria)
- High fevers can damage proteins and cause brain injury
- Cooling reduces fever by increasing heat loss
- Too rapid cooling causes shivering (generates heat, counterproductive)
- Hydration is critical because fever increases fluid loss

CLEAN VS DIRTY VS LAST-RESORT:
- Clean: Thermometer, clean water, proper medicines (ideal)
- Dirty: Hand to feel temperature, available water (acceptable)
- Last-resort: Obviously contaminated water (use if nothing else - cooling is priority)

MYTHS CORRECTED:
- "Sweat out a fever" - FALSE: Bundling up traps heat, dangerous
- "Fever is always bad" - FALSE: Mild fever helps fight infection
- "Ice is best for fever" - FALSE: Causes shivering, raises temperature

FEVER IN CHILDREN:
- Children get fevers more easily than adults
- Febrile seizures are common (usually not dangerous)
- Watch for signs of serious illness
- Keep child cool and hydrated
- Do NOT overdress child
- See child_emergency_care.md for pediatric-specific guidance

FEVER IN ELDERLY:
- Elderly may not show high fever even with serious infection
- Watch for confusion or behavior changes
- May need more aggressive cooling
- Monitor closely

FEVER WITH SPECIFIC SYMPTOMS:

FEVER + STIFF NECK + HEADACHE:
- Possible meningitis (brain infection)
- Keep person still
- Dark, quiet room
- This is life-threatening - get help if possible
- MENINGITIS RECOGNITION:
  * Fever with severe headache
  * Stiff neck (cannot touch chin to chest)
  * Light sensitivity (photophobia)
  * Confusion or altered consciousness
  * Nausea and vomiting
  * Rash (in some types)
  * In infants: Bulging fontanelle, high-pitched cry
  * This is life-threatening emergency
  * Requires antibiotics immediately (may not be available)
  * Monitor very closely
  * Be prepared for rapid deterioration

FEVER + DIFFICULTY BREATHING:
- Possible pneumonia or respiratory infection
- Keep person sitting up if possible
- Monitor breathing closely
- Can be fatal

FEVER + SEIZURES:
- Febrile seizures in children (usually not dangerous)
- Keep person safe (on side, clear area)
- Do NOT put anything in mouth
- Usually stops in 1-2 minutes
- Seizures with fever in adults are more serious
- FEBRILE SEIZURE MANAGEMENT:
  * Most common in children 6 months to 5 years
  * Usually occur when fever is rising rapidly
  * Most last less than 5 minutes
  * Do NOT try to stop seizure - let it run its course
  * Protect person from injury (clear area, cushion head)
  * Time the seizure if possible
  * After seizure: Position on side, monitor breathing
  * Continue fever management
  * Most children recover fully
  * If seizure lasts more than 5 minutes: This is serious
