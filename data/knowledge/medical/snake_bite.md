TITLE: Snake Bite Management

KEYWORDS: snake bite, envenomation, venom, snakebite, puncture wound, antivenom

SEVERITY LEVELS:
- Mild: Puncture marks, minimal pain, no swelling, no systemic symptoms
- Serious: Puncture marks, pain, swelling, some systemic symptoms (nausea, weakness)
- Life-threatening: Severe swelling, difficulty breathing, paralysis, loss of consciousness

WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE:
- Bite from a snake or suspected snake bite
- Puncture marks on skin with pain or swelling
- Person was near snake and has symptoms
- Unknown bite with snake-like symptoms

IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES:
1. Preserve life - Some snake bites are fatal
2. Prevent venom spread - Keep person still
3. Monitor closely - Symptoms can worsen rapidly
4. Get help if possible - Antivenom may be needed

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Venom can cause paralysis and respiratory failure
- Some venoms cause severe bleeding
- Swelling can be severe
- Time is critical - symptoms can worsen rapidly
- Antivenom may be required (not available in austere settings)

STEP-BY-STEP TREATMENT:

1. MOVE PERSON AWAY FROM SNAKE:
   - Ensure snake is gone or safely away
   - Do NOT try to kill or capture snake (risk of another bite)
   - Move person to safe location
   - Do NOT delay treatment

2. KEEP PERSON CALM AND STILL:
   - Movement increases venom spread
   - Keep person lying down
   - Reassure person (anxiety increases heart rate, spreads venom)
   - Do NOT allow person to walk or move

3. IMMOBILIZE THE BITTEN LIMB:
   - Keep limb still using splint or cloth
   - Do NOT elevate (keep below heart level)
   - Immobilize joint above and below bite
   - Prevent any movement of limb

4. POSITION THE PERSON:
   - Lay person down
   - Keep bitten area below heart level
   - Keep person still and calm
   - Do NOT elevate bitten limb

5. REMOVE CONSTRICTIVE ITEMS:
   - Remove jewelry, watches, tight clothing near bite
   - Swelling will occur - remove before it becomes impossible
   - Do NOT apply tourniquet

6. MONITOR CLOSELY:
   - Watch for signs of envenomation (see vital signs)
   - Check breathing regularly
   - Monitor consciousness
   - Watch for worsening

FOR SPECIFIC WOUND TYPES / SPECIAL CASES:

NON-VENOMOUS SNAKE BITE:
- May still cause infection
- Clean wound (see wound_care.md)
- Monitor for infection
- Usually not life-threatening

VENOMOUS SNAKE BITE - NEUROTOXIC (PARALYSIS):
- May cause difficulty breathing
- May cause paralysis
- Monitor breathing closely
- Be prepared for rescue breathing (see airway_obstruction.md)

VENOMOUS SNAKE BITE - HEMOTOXIC (BLEEDING):
- May cause bleeding problems
- May cause tissue damage
- Monitor for bleeding
- See bleeding.md if bleeding occurs

VENOMOUS SNAKE BITE - CYTOTOXIC (TISSUE DAMAGE):
- May cause severe swelling
- May cause tissue death
- Monitor for compartment syndrome
- Keep limb immobilized

SNAKE BITE IN CHILDREN:
- Children are more vulnerable (smaller body, more venom per kg)
- Monitor more frequently
- Symptoms may appear faster
- See child_emergency_care.md for pediatric specifics

VITAL SIGNS TO CHECK:

SWELLING:
- Mild: Minimal swelling at bite site
- Moderate: Swelling spreading beyond bite site
- Severe: Rapid, extensive swelling

PAIN:
- Mild: Minimal pain
- Moderate: Significant pain
- Severe: Severe pain, may spread

BREATHING:
- Normal: No difficulty
- Moderate: Some difficulty, rapid breathing
- Severe: Severe difficulty, may stop (life-threatening)

CONSCIOUSNESS:
- Normal: Alert
- Moderate: Drowsy, weak
- Severe: Loss of consciousness (life-threatening)

PULSE:
- Normal: Regular
- Moderate: Rapid, weak
- Severe: Very rapid, weak, or irregular

NAUSEA AND VOMITING:
- May indicate systemic envenomation
- Monitor closely if present

BLEEDING:
- Check for bleeding from bite site
- Check for bleeding from other sites (gums, etc.)
- May indicate hemotoxic venom

WHEN PROFESSIONAL HELP IS UNAVAILABLE:

WHAT YOU CAN DO:
- Keep person still and calm
- Immobilize bitten limb
- Monitor closely
- Some bites may not be venomous
- Some may have minimal envenomation
- Focus on preventing spread and monitoring

REALITY CHECK:
- Antivenom may be required but is not available
- Some bites will be fatal without antivenom
- Some people will die despite best efforts
- Focus on what can be done
- Accept limitations

LONG-TERM CARE:

IF PERSON SURVIVES:
- Monitor for complications
- Wound may require ongoing care
- Some tissue damage may be permanent
- Recovery may take weeks to months
- See wound_care.md for wound management

MONITORING:
- Check for ongoing symptoms
- Watch for delayed effects
- Monitor wound healing
- Watch for infection

PREVENTION:

AVOID SNAKES:
- Be aware of snake habitats
- Watch where you step
- Use flashlight at night
- Do not reach into areas you cannot see
- Wear protective footwear

IF YOU SEE A SNAKE:
- Back away slowly
- Do not approach
- Do not try to kill or capture
- Give snake space to escape

REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS:

WITH PROPER CARE:
- Non-venomous bites usually heal without problems
- Some venomous bites may have minimal envenomation
- Proper immobilization may limit spread
- Some people survive without antivenom

WITHOUT PROFESSIONAL HELP:
- Antivenom may be required but is not available
- Some bites will be fatal without antivenom
- Some people will die despite best efforts
- Focus on what can be done
- Accept limitations

NOT ALL BITES ARE VENOMOUS:
- Many snake bites do not inject venom (dry bites)
- Some inject minimal venom
- Monitor closely but do not assume worst case

DO NOT:
- DO NOT cut the wound (does not help, causes more damage)
- DO NOT suck the venom (does not help, can cause infection)
- DO NOT apply ice or chemicals (does not help, can cause damage)
- DO NOT use tourniquet (does not help, can cause tissue damage)
- DO NOT give alcohol (increases heart rate, spreads venom)
- DO NOT give food (may need surgery, aspiration risk)
- DO NOT allow person to walk or move (spreads venom)
- DO NOT elevate bitten limb (keep below heart level)
- DO NOT try to capture or kill snake (risk of another bite)
