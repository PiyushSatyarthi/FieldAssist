TITLE: Burn Management

KEYWORDS: burns, thermal burn, chemical burn, electrical burn, scald, fire injury, burn depth, burn percentage

SEVERITY LEVELS:
- Mild (First degree): Red, painful, no blisters, heals in days
- Serious (Second degree): Blistered, painful, heals in weeks if no infection
- Life-threatening (Third/Fourth degree): White/black/charred, may be painless, requires surgery, large burns cause shock

WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE:
- Thermal burns (fire, hot liquids, steam)
- Chemical burns
- Electrical burns
- Sunburn (severe)
- Any burn larger than person's palm
- Burns on face, hands, feet, genitals
- Burns with breathing problems

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Large burns cause massive fluid loss leading to shock
- Burns can cause airway obstruction if face/neck burned
- Infection risk increases with burn size and depth
- Third/fourth degree burns will not heal without surgery
- Time is critical: Cooling within first 20 minutes significantly improves outcomes

STEP-BY-STEP ACTIONS (DO THIS IN ORDER):

1. REMOVE FROM HEAT SOURCE:
   - Stop, drop, and roll if clothing on fire
   - Smother flames with blanket, coat, or dirt
   - Remove person from hot area immediately
   - Do not use your bare hands on hot surfaces

2. COOL THE BURN (CRITICAL - FIRST 20 MINUTES):
   - Use clean, cool (not ice cold) running water
   - Cool for minimum 15-20 minutes
   - Continue until pain significantly reduces
   - If no running water: Pour clean water repeatedly from container
   - Submerge limb in clean water if possible
   - Do NOT use ice or very cold water (causes tissue damage and hypothermia)
   - Cooling reduces depth of burn and pain

3. REMOVE CONSTRICTIVE ITEMS:
   - Remove jewelry, watches, tight clothing
   - Do this WHILE cooling if possible
   - Cut clothing if stuck to burn
   - Do NOT pull clothing that is stuck - leave it
   - Remove items before swelling makes it impossible

4. ASSESS BURN SEVERITY:
   - First degree: Red, painful, dry, no blisters
   - Second degree: Red, painful, blistered, wet appearance
   - Third degree: White, black, or charred, may be painless (nerves destroyed)
   - Fourth degree: Through skin, muscle, to bone
   - Estimate size: Person's palm = 1% of body surface

5. COVER THE BURN:
   - Use clean, non-stick material
   - Cloth, bandage, or clean clothing
   - Cover loosely - do not wrap tightly
   - Do NOT use fluffy materials (cotton balls, wool) - fibers stick to wound
   - Plastic wrap is excellent if available (keeps air out, reduces pain)

6. PREVENT SHOCK (LARGE BURNS):
   - Large burns cause massive fluid loss
   - Keep person warm (cover unburned areas)
   - Elevate burned limbs if possible
   - Begin rehydration if person is conscious (see dehydration.md)
   - Monitor for signs of shock (see shock.md)
   - Do NOT give food or water if severe burn (may need surgery)
   - FLUID NEEDS FOR LARGE BURNS:
     * Burns >10% body surface: Significant fluid loss
     * Burns >20% body surface: Massive fluid loss, life-threatening
     * Person needs 2-3x normal fluid intake
     * Continue for days after burn
     * Use oral rehydration solution if available
     * Monitor urine output closely

7. MONITOR BREATHING:
   - Burns to face/neck can cause airway problems
   - Watch for difficulty breathing, hoarse voice, soot in nose/mouth
   - Inhalation injury is serious - keep person sitting up if possible
   - See airway_obstruction.md if breathing problems
   - INHALATION INJURY RECOGNITION:
     * Burns to face or neck
     * Soot in nose or mouth
     * Singed nasal hairs or eyebrows
     * Hoarse voice or difficulty speaking
     * Coughing up black material
     * Difficulty breathing
     * This is life-threatening - monitor very closely
     * Airway can swell and close - be prepared for rescue breathing

WHAT NOT TO DO:
- DO NOT apply butter, oil, grease, or any cooking substances
- DO NOT apply toothpaste, mud, ash, or plant pastes
- DO NOT break blisters unnecessarily (they protect underlying skin)
- DO NOT use ice directly on burn (causes frostbite and tissue damage)
- DO NOT tightly wrap burns (needs airflow for healing)
- DO NOT remove stuck clothing (cut around it)
- DO NOT give alcohol (increases shock risk)
- DO NOT use adhesive bandages directly on burn (sticks to wound)
- DO NOT submerge large burns in water (causes hypothermia)

IMPROVISED / LOW-RESOURCE OPTIONS:

NO CLEAN WATER:
- Use cleanest water available (rainwater, boiled and cooled water)
- If only dirty water: Use it anyway - cooling is critical, infection is secondary
- Do NOT use salt water if avoidable (increases pain)
- Continue cooling despite water quality

NO CLEAN CLOTH:
- Use cleanest fabric available
- Boil cloth if possible, then let cool
- Tear clean clothing into strips
- If nothing clean: Use whatever prevents contamination
- Better to use dirty cloth than leave burn exposed

IMPROVISED DRESSINGS:
- Clean cloth (best available option)
- Plastic wrap or bags (excellent - keeps air out, reduces pain)
- Clean leaves (large, non-toxic - boil first if possible)
- Do NOT use: Butter, oil, mud, or unknown substances

COOLING METHODS:
- Running water is best
- Pouring water repeatedly is acceptable
- Wet compresses changed frequently
- Submerge small burns in container of water
- Do NOT use ice or snow directly

WHEN YOU MUST SEEK PROFESSIONAL HELP:
- Burns larger than person's palm
- Third or fourth degree burns (white/black/charred)
- Burns on face, hands, feet, genitals
- Burns with breathing problems
- Chemical or electrical burns
- Burns causing shock
- Person requires skin grafts or surgical intervention (not available)

REALISTIC OUTCOMES & LIMITATIONS:

WITH PROPER CARE:
- First degree burns heal in 3-6 days
- Second degree burns heal in 2-3 weeks if no infection
- Proper cooling reduces burn depth significantly
- Small burns usually heal without problems

WITHOUT PROFESSIONAL HELP:
- Third/fourth degree burns will not heal without surgery
- Large burns may cause death from shock or infection
- Some burns will become infected despite best efforts
- Scarring and contractures are likely with deep burns
- Person may die from severe burns even with care

LONG-TERM:
- Burns heal from edges inward
- May take weeks to months
- Scarring is likely with deep burns
- Contractures (tightening) may occur - gentle stretching helps
- Protect healing skin from sun (causes permanent darkening)
- Nutrition is critical for healing

SAFETY & ACCURACY RULES:

MEDICAL REASONING:
- Cooling within 20 minutes reduces burn depth by limiting tissue damage
- Cold water causes vasoconstriction and can cause hypothermia
- Ice causes additional tissue damage (frostbite)
- Blisters protect underlying skin and should be left intact when possible
- Large burns cause massive fluid loss through damaged skin

CLEAN VS DIRTY VS LAST-RESORT:
- Clean: Sterile dressings, clean running water (ideal but often unavailable)
- Dirty: Cleanest available water and materials (acceptable)
- Last-resort: Obviously contaminated materials (use only if nothing else - cooling is priority)

MYTHS CORRECTED:
- "Butter helps burns" - FALSE: Traps heat, increases infection risk
- "Break blisters" - FALSE: Blisters protect skin, breaking increases infection risk
- "Ice is best for burns" - FALSE: Causes additional tissue damage

SPECIFIC BURN TYPES:

THERMAL BURNS:
- Most common type
- Follow standard cooling procedure
- Remove hot clothing carefully
- Do not break blisters

CHEMICAL BURNS:
- Flush with LARGE amounts of water (20+ minutes minimum)
- Remove contaminated clothing while flushing
- Brush off dry chemicals before flushing
- Continue flushing even if person says it's better
- Do NOT neutralize acids with bases (causes heat reaction)
- Some chemicals require specific treatment (if known)

ELECTRICAL BURNS:
- Ensure power is OFF before touching person
- May have entry and exit wounds
- Can cause heart problems - monitor closely
- May have internal damage not visible
- Keep person still and monitor breathing
- May need CPR if heart stopped

SUNBURN:
- Cool with water or cool compresses
- Keep out of sun
- Stay hydrated
- Aloe vera helps if available (from plant, not commercial product)
- Pain usually resolves in 2-3 days
- Severe sunburn can cause dehydration and shock

BURN PERCENTAGE ESTIMATION:
- Person's palm = 1% of body surface
- Rule of nines (adults):
  * Head and neck: 9%
  * Each arm: 9%
  * Front of torso: 18%
  * Back of torso: 18%
  * Each leg: 18%
  * Genitals: 1%
- Rule of nines (children - different proportions):
  * Head and neck: 18% (infants), 15% (children)
  * Each arm: 9%
  * Front of torso: 18%
  * Back of torso: 18%
  * Each leg: 14% (infants), 16% (children)
- Burns >10% body surface can cause shock
- Burns >20% are life-threatening without medical care
- Burns >30% are usually fatal without advanced medical care
- Accurate estimation helps assess severity and fluid needs
