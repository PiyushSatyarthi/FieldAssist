TITLE: Hypothermia Management

KEYWORDS: hypothermia, cold exposure, low body temperature, rewarming, cold injury, shivering

SEVERITY LEVELS:
- Mild: Shivering, alert, can help self
- Serious: Shivering stops, confusion, difficulty moving
- Life-threatening: No shivering, unconscious, slow/irregular breathing, very low temperature

WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE:
- Person exposed to cold temperatures
- Person is wet and cold
- Shivering that does not stop
- Confusion or slurred speech in cold conditions
- Person found in cold environment
- Loss of consciousness in cold

IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES:
1. Preserve life - Hypothermia can be fatal
2. Remove from cold immediately
3. Prevent further heat loss
4. Rewarm slowly and safely

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Hypothermia can cause death
- Rapid rewarming can cause dangerous heart rhythms
- Moving person roughly can cause cardiac arrest
- Wet clothing increases heat loss dramatically
- Time is critical - act quickly but carefully

STEP-BY-STEP TREATMENT:

1. REMOVE FROM COLD:
   - Move person to warm, dry shelter immediately
   - Do NOT delay - every minute matters
   - Protect from wind and further cold
   - If cannot move: Protect person where they are

2. REMOVE WET CLOTHING:
   - Wet clothing increases heat loss
   - Remove carefully to avoid rough movement
   - Cut clothing if necessary
   - Replace with dry clothing or blankets

3. INSULATE FROM GROUND:
   - Place person on insulating material
   - Ground conducts heat away
   - Use blankets, clothing, or whatever available
   - Keep person off cold ground

4. REWARM SLOWLY:
   - Wrap in dry blankets or clothing
   - Use body heat from others if safe
   - Warm the core first (chest, neck, armpits, groin)
   - Do NOT warm extremities first (causes dangerous blood flow)
   - Do NOT use direct heat (fire, heater) - causes burns and dangerous rewarming

5. IF CONSCIOUS:
   - Give warm sweet drinks (not hot)
   - Do NOT give alcohol (increases heat loss)
   - Do NOT give caffeine (increases heat loss)
   - Warm fluids help rewarm from inside

6. MONITOR CLOSELY:
   - Watch for worsening
   - Check breathing and pulse
   - Watch for signs of improvement
   - Do NOT leave person alone

FOR SPECIFIC WOUND TYPES / SPECIAL CASES:

MILD HYPOTHERMIA (SHIVERING, ALERT):
- Person can help self
- Remove from cold
- Remove wet clothing
- Wrap in dry blankets
- Give warm drinks
- Monitor for improvement

MODERATE HYPOTHERMIA (SHIVERING STOPS, CONFUSED):
- Person cannot help self
- Handle gently - rough movement dangerous
- Remove from cold carefully
- Remove wet clothing
- Wrap in dry blankets
- Use body heat from others
- Monitor breathing closely

SEVERE HYPOTHERMIA (NO SHIVERING, UNCONSCIOUS):
- Life-threatening
- Handle very gently - any rough movement can cause cardiac arrest
- Remove from cold very carefully
- Remove wet clothing carefully
- Wrap in dry blankets
- Use body heat from others
- Monitor breathing and pulse continuously
- Be prepared for CPR (see airway_obstruction.md)

HYPOTHERMIA WITH FROSTBITE:
- Treat hypothermia first (life-threatening)
- Do NOT rewarm frostbite if refreezing possible
- See frostbite.md for frostbite management
- Hypothermia takes priority

HYPOTHERMIA IN WATER:
- Remove from water immediately
- Remove wet clothing
- Dry person completely
- Wrap in dry blankets
- Rewarm slowly
- Monitor closely

VITAL SIGNS TO CHECK:

SHIVERING:
- Mild: Shivering present, person alert
- Moderate: Shivering stops, person confused
- Severe: No shivering, person unconscious

CONSCIOUSNESS:
- Mild: Alert, can help self
- Moderate: Confused, slurred speech, difficulty moving
- Severe: Unconscious, unresponsive

BREATHING:
- Mild: Normal
- Moderate: Slow, shallow
- Severe: Very slow, irregular, may stop

PULSE:
- Mild: Normal or slightly slow
- Moderate: Slow, weak
- Severe: Very slow, weak, may be difficult to feel

SKIN TEMPERATURE:
- Mild: Cold to touch
- Moderate: Very cold
- Severe: Extremely cold, may feel dead

COORDINATION:
- Mild: Can move, some clumsiness
- Moderate: Difficulty moving, stumbling
- Severe: Cannot move, rigid

WHEN PROFESSIONAL HELP IS UNAVAILABLE:

WHAT YOU CAN DO:
- Remove from cold immediately
- Remove wet clothing
- Insulate from ground
- Rewarm slowly using body heat and blankets
- Monitor closely
- Some will recover with proper rewarming

REALITY CHECK:
- Severe hypothermia may not resolve without advanced care
- Some people will die despite best efforts
- Rough handling can cause cardiac arrest
- Focus on gentle, slow rewarming
- Accept limitations

LONG-TERM CARE:

AFTER REWARMING:
- Keep person warm
- Monitor for complications
- May take hours to fully recover
- Watch for signs of frostbite
- Ensure adequate nutrition and hydration

MONITORING:
- Check for return of normal function
- Watch for signs of complications
- Monitor for frostbite
- Ensure person stays warm

PREVENTION:

CLOTHING:
- Dress in layers
- Keep dry
- Protect extremities
- Use waterproof outer layer if wet conditions

SHELTER:
- Stay in warm, dry shelter
- Avoid prolonged cold exposure
- Use insulation from ground
- Protect from wind

NUTRITION:
- Eat regularly (body needs fuel to generate heat)
- Stay hydrated
- Avoid alcohol (increases heat loss)

RECOGNIZE EARLY SIGNS:
- Shivering is first sign
- Act before shivering stops
- Do not ignore cold exposure
- Get to warmth early

REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS:

WITH PROPER CARE:
- Mild hypothermia usually resolves with rewarming
- Moderate hypothermia may take hours to recover
- Proper rewarming prevents most complications
- Most people recover fully

WITHOUT PROFESSIONAL HELP:
- Severe hypothermia may not resolve without advanced care
- Some people will die despite best efforts
- Rough handling can cause cardiac arrest
- Focus on gentle, slow rewarming
- Accept limitations

REWARMING TIME:
- Mild: Minutes to hours
- Moderate: Hours
- Severe: May not recover without advanced care

DO NOT:
- DO NOT rub limbs vigorously (causes dangerous blood flow, can cause cardiac arrest)
- DO NOT apply direct heat like fire or heater (causes burns and dangerous rewarming)
- DO NOT give alcohol (increases heat loss)
- DO NOT give caffeine (increases heat loss)
- DO NOT warm extremities first (causes dangerous blood flow)
- DO NOT move person roughly (can cause cardiac arrest)
- DO NOT ignore shivering (early sign - act immediately)
- DO NOT leave person alone
