TITLE: Dehydration Management

KEYWORDS: dehydration, fluid loss, oral rehydration, ORS, hypovolemia, fluid replacement, WHO IMCI

SEVERITY LEVELS:
- Mild: Thirst, dry mouth, dark urine, less frequent urination
- Serious: Very dry mouth/skin, little/no urination 4+ hours, dizziness, rapid pulse
- Life-threatening: No urination 8+ hours, confusion, loss of consciousness, shock

WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE:
- Person has not urinated in 4+ hours
- Dark yellow urine or no urine
- Dry mouth and skin
- Person with diarrhea or vomiting
- Person with fever
- Person with burns
- Signs of fluid loss (sweating, bleeding)
- Person in hot weather without adequate fluids

IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES:
1. Preserve life - Severe dehydration can kill within days
2. Begin rehydration immediately - Do not wait
3. Prevent worsening - Start at first signs
4. Monitor closely - Check vital signs frequently

MODERATE DEHYDRATION:
- Very dry mouth and skin
- Little or no urination (4+ hours)
- Dark urine (if any)
- Dizziness or lightheadedness
- Weakness
- Rapid heartbeat
- Sunken eyes
- Irritability

SEVERE DEHYDRATION (LIFE-THREATENING):
- No urination for 8+ hours
- Very dark urine or none
- Extreme thirst (or loss of thirst - bad sign)
- Very dry mouth and skin
- Sunken eyes and fontanelle (in infants)
- Rapid breathing
- Rapid, weak pulse
- Confusion or irritability
- Fainting or loss of consciousness
- Cold hands and feet
- Wrinkled skin that doesn't bounce back when pinched

1. ASSESS SEVERITY:
   - Check for signs (see vital signs below)
   - Determine if mild, moderate, or severe
   - Check urine output and color
   - Check skin elasticity (pinch test)
   - Check consciousness level

2. BEGIN REHYDRATION IMMEDIATELY:
   - Do NOT wait - start at first signs
   - Use Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) if available
   - If no ORS: Make homemade (see below)
   - Give small sips frequently (every 5-10 minutes)
   - Do NOT give large amounts at once (causes vomiting)

3. ORAL REHYDRATION SOLUTION (ORS):
   - If packets available: Mix according to instructions (WHO standard)
   - Homemade recipe (WHO-approved):
     * 1 liter CLEAN water
     * 6 level teaspoons sugar
     * 1/2 level teaspoon salt
     * Mix until dissolved
   - Give after every loose stool or vomiting episode
   - Continue until person urinates normally
   - No maximum - give as needed

4. IF VOMITING:
   - Give even smaller amounts (1 teaspoon every 2-3 minutes)
   - Wait 10 minutes after vomiting, then resume
   - Continue despite vomiting - some will be absorbed
   - If severe vomiting: May need to wait briefly, then try again

5. MONITOR URINATION:
   - Person should urinate within 4-6 hours of starting rehydration
   - Urine should become lighter in color
   - If no urination after 6 hours: Increase fluid intake
   - If still no urination after 12 hours: This is critical

6. TREAT UNDERLYING CAUSE:
   - Diarrhea: Continue ORS (see diarrhea.md)
   - Vomiting: Small frequent sips (see food_poisoning.md)
   - Fever: Increase fluid intake (see fever.md)
   - Burns: Massive fluid needs (see burns.md)

BASIC RECIPE:
- 1 liter (4 cups) of CLEAN water
- 6 level teaspoons of sugar
- 1/2 level teaspoon of salt
- Mix until dissolved
- Give small sips frequently

ALTERNATIVE RECIPES:

IF NO MEASURING SPOONS:
- 1 liter clean water
- 2 large pinches of salt
- 8 large pinches of sugar
- Mix well

IF NO SUGAR:
- Use honey if available (same amount)
- Or use fruit juice diluted 1:1 with water, add salt

IF NO SALT:
- Use broth or soup (has natural salt)
- Or use coconut water if available
- Plain water is better than nothing

IMPROVISED REHYDRATION:

NO CLEAN WATER:
- Use cleanest water available (rainwater, boiled water)
- If only dirty water: Boil if possible, or use anyway (dehydration is more dangerous)
- Filter through cloth if very dirty

NO SUGAR OR SALT:
- Plain water is better than nothing
- Broth or soup provides some electrolytes
- Coconut water is excellent if available
- Diluted fruit juice helps

ALTERNATIVE FLUIDS:
- Broth or soup (warm or cool, not hot)
- Herbal tea (cooled, no caffeine)
- Diluted fruit juice (1 part juice, 1 part water)
- Coconut water (natural electrolytes)
- Do NOT use: Alcohol, coffee, energy drinks, undiluted juice

FOR SPECIFIC CAUSES:

DEHYDRATION FROM DIARRHEA:
- Most common cause
- Continue ORS even while diarrhea continues
- Do NOT stop fluids thinking it will stop diarrhea
- See diarrhea.md for complete management

DEHYDRATION FROM VOMITING:
- Give very small amounts frequently
- Wait after vomiting episodes
- Continue despite vomiting
- May need to treat cause of vomiting

DEHYDRATION FROM FEVER:
- Fever increases fluid needs significantly
- Person needs extra water
- Cool fluids help reduce fever
- Continue until fever breaks and person is well

DEHYDRATION FROM HEAT:
- Move to shade immediately
- Remove excess clothing
- Cool the person (wet cloths, fanning)
- Rehydrate with cool (not cold) fluids
- Rest is essential

DEHYDRATION FROM BURNS:
- Burns cause massive fluid loss
- Person needs 2-3x normal fluid intake
- Continue for days after burn
- Monitor closely

DEHYDRATION IN CHILDREN:
- Children dehydrate faster than adults
- Watch for: No tears when crying, sunken fontanelle (infants), dry mouth
- Begin rehydration immediately
- Use ORS (WHO IMCI standard)
- See child_emergency_care.md for pediatric specifics

INFANTS:
- More vulnerable than adults
- Dehydrate faster
- Watch for: Sunken fontanelle (soft spot), no tears when crying, dry mouth
- Give ORS or breastmilk frequently
- Small amounts every few minutes

CHILDREN:
- May not recognize thirst
- Monitor closely
- Begin rehydration at first signs

VITAL SIGNS TO CHECK:

GENERAL PREVENTION:
- Drink water regularly, don't wait for thirst
- Increase intake in hot weather
- Increase intake during illness
- Increase intake during physical work
- Monitor urine color (should be light yellow)

SKIN ELASTICITY (PINCH TEST):
- Normal: Skin returns immediately when pinched
- Mild: Slight delay in return
- Moderate: Slow return (1-2 seconds)
- Severe: Very slow return or stays pinched

IN HOT WEATHER:
- Drink before feeling thirsty
- Rest in shade during hottest hours
- Wear light, breathable clothing
- Avoid excessive physical work in heat

EYES:
- Normal: Eyes appear normal
- Moderate: Slightly sunken
- Severe: Very sunken

MINIMAL WATER:
- Prioritize rehydration over other uses
- Use every drop available
- Collect rainwater if possible
- Find water sources (streams, wells, etc.)
- Boil water if possible to prevent more illness

NO CLEAN WATER:
- Boil water if possible (kills bacteria)
- Filter through clean cloth
- Let sediment settle, use clear water from top
- In emergency: Use dirty water - dehydration kills faster than most waterborne illness

NO SALT OR SUGAR:
- Plain water prevents death from dehydration
- Look for natural sources (coconut water, broth from cooking)
- Some plants have natural electrolytes (research local plants if possible)

MONITORING RECOVERY:

SIGNS OF IMPROVEMENT:
- Person starts urinating (within 4-6 hours)
- Urine becomes lighter in color
- Thirst decreases
- Skin becomes less dry
- Person becomes more alert
- Eyes less sunken
- Pulse becomes stronger and slower

CONTINUE REHYDRATION UNTIL:
- Person urinates normally (every 2-4 hours)
- Urine is light yellow
- No signs of dehydration remain
- May take 24-48 hours for full recovery

WARNING SIGNS - CRITICAL:

SEEK HELP IF POSSIBLE WHEN:
- No urination for 12+ hours
- Person is unconscious or very confused
- Rapid, weak pulse that's hard to feel
- Very rapid breathing
- Cold, clammy skin
- Person cannot drink or keep fluids down
- Severe dehydration in infant or elderly

WHEN PROFESSIONAL HELP IS UNAVAILABLE:

WHAT YOU CAN DO:
- Continue oral rehydration efforts
- Monitor vital signs frequently
- Some will recover with oral rehydration
- Some may need IV fluids that are not available
- Do your best with available resources
- Focus on preventing worsening

REALITY CHECK:
- Severe dehydration may not resolve without IV fluids
- Some people will die from dehydration despite efforts
- Prevention is always better than treatment
- Start rehydration at first signs - don't wait

DO NOT:
- Do NOT give large amounts of water at once (causes vomiting)
- Do NOT stop fluids to "rest the stomach"
- Do NOT give only plain water if ORS is possible (less effective)
- Do NOT give alcohol, coffee, or caffeinated drinks (dehydrate more)
- Do NOT wait for severe signs before starting treatment
- Do NOT ignore early signs of dehydration

LONG-TERM CARE:

AFTER RECOVERY:
- Continue adequate hydration
- Person may need extra fluids for days
- Monitor for recurrence
- Address underlying cause (diarrhea, etc.)

MONITORING:
- Check urine output regularly
- Watch for signs of recurrence
- Ensure adequate fluid intake
- Monitor for complications

PREVENTION:

GENERAL PREVENTION:
- Drink water regularly, do not wait for thirst
- Increase intake in hot weather
- Increase intake during illness
- Increase intake during physical work
- Monitor urine color (should be light yellow)

DURING ILLNESS:
- Start rehydration at first sign of diarrhea or vomiting
- Do not wait for dehydration to develop
- Prevention is easier than treatment
- Have ORS available if possible

IN HOT WEATHER:
- Drink before feeling thirsty
- Rest in shade during hottest hours
- Wear light, breathable clothing
- Avoid excessive physical work in heat

REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS:

WITH PROPER CARE:
- Mild to moderate dehydration usually resolves with rehydration
- Oral rehydration is effective for most cases
- Proper ORS use prevents most deaths
- Most people recover fully

WITHOUT PROFESSIONAL HELP:
- Severe dehydration may not resolve without IV fluids
- Some people will die from dehydration despite efforts
- Prevention is always better than treatment
- Start rehydration at first signs - do not wait
- Oral rehydration has limits but is often sufficient

CHILDREN AND ELDERLY:
- More vulnerable - deteriorate faster
- Require more frequent monitoring
- May need more aggressive rehydration
- Higher risk of complications

DO NOT:
- DO NOT give large amounts of water at once (causes vomiting)
- DO NOT stop fluids to "rest the stomach" (WRONG - causes dehydration)
- DO NOT give only plain water if ORS is possible (less effective)
- DO NOT give alcohol, coffee, or caffeinated drinks (dehydrate more)
- DO NOT wait for severe signs before starting treatment
- DO NOT ignore early signs of dehydration
- DO NOT give fluids to unconscious person (choking risk)
- DO NOT stop ORS when diarrhea continues (continue until well)
