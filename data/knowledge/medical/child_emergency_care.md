TITLE: Pediatric Emergency Care - Children and Infants

KEYWORDS: pediatric, child, infant, baby, children's medicine, child CPR, pediatric emergency, WHO IMCI

SEVERITY LEVELS:
- Mild: Child alert, breathing normally, minor injury
- Serious: Child distressed, difficulty breathing, significant injury
- Life-threatening: Child unconscious, not breathing, severe injury, shock

WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE:
- Medical emergency involving child (under 18 years)
- Infant (under 1 year) emergency
- Dosage calculations for children
- Child-specific considerations
- Any emergency where age affects treatment
- Following WHO IMCI (Integrated Management of Childhood Illness) protocols

IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES:
1. Preserve life - Children deteriorate faster than adults
2. Prevent harm - Dosage errors can be fatal
3. Assess accurately - Children cannot always communicate symptoms
4. Act quickly - Smaller bodies mean smaller margins for error

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Children deteriorate faster than adults - minutes matter
- Dosage errors can be fatal - never guess pediatric dosages
- Children cannot always communicate symptoms - rely on observation
- Smaller bodies mean smaller margins for error
- Time is critical - act quickly but accurately
- Children have different vital sign norms than adults

STEP-BY-STEP TREATMENT:

1. ASSESS SIZE AND AGE:
   - Determine if infant (<1 year), child (1-12 years), or adolescent (13-17 years)
   - Estimate or measure weight if possible (most accurate for dosages)
   - Use age if weight unknown (less accurate)
   - See common_medicines.md for pediatric dosages
   - Weight-based dosing is mandatory when possible (WHO IMCI standard)

2. ASSESS CONSCIOUSNESS (AVPU SCALE):
   - Alert: Child is awake and aware
   - Voice: Responds to voice
   - Pain: Responds only to pain
   - Unresponsive: No response
   - For infants: Tap foot, call name, check for movement

3. CHECK BREATHING:
   - Look for chest movement
   - Listen for breath sounds
   - Feel for air movement
   - Count respiratory rate (see vital signs below)
   - Infants: Check more frequently (breathing is irregular normally)
   - If not breathing: Begin rescue breathing immediately

4. CHILD/INFANT CPR (IF NOT BREATHING):
   - INFANTS (<1 year):
     * Use 2 fingers for chest compressions
     * Center of chest, just below nipple line
     * Depth: 1.5 inches (4cm) or 1/3 chest depth
     * Rate: 100-120 per minute
     * 30 compressions to 2 breaths
     * Cover mouth and nose with your mouth for breaths
   
   - CHILDREN (1-12 years):
     * Use 1 or 2 hands depending on child size
     * Center of chest
     * Depth: 2 inches (5cm) or 1/3 chest depth
     * Rate: 100-120 per minute
     * 30 compressions to 2 breaths
     * Cover mouth with your mouth, pinch nose

5. CHOKING (INFANTS):
   - Hold infant face down on your forearm
   - Support head and neck
   - Head lower than body
   - Give 5 back blows between shoulder blades
   - Turn infant over, support head
   - Give 5 chest thrusts (2 fingers, center of chest)
   - Repeat until object expelled or infant unconscious

6. CHOKING (CHILDREN):
   - Use Heimlich maneuver (same as adults but adjust force)
   - Stand behind child
   - Place hands just above navel
   - Give upward thrusts
   - Continue until object expelled or child unconscious

7. MEDICATION DOSAGES:
   - ALWAYS use weight-based dosing if possible (WHO IMCI standard)
   - Use age-based only if weight unknown (less accurate)
   - Children need smaller dosages than adults
   - Do NOT give adult dosages to children
   - See common_medicines.md for specific dosages
   - When in doubt: Give less, not more

FOR SPECIFIC WOUND TYPES / SPECIAL CASES:

INFANTS (<1 YEAR):
- Fontanelle (soft spot) - sunken indicates dehydration (critical sign)
- Irregular breathing is normal - do not overreact
- Cannot communicate symptoms - rely on observation
- Need smaller dosages - weight-based mandatory
- More vulnerable to dehydration and infection
- Febrile seizures more common (usually not dangerous)
- See dehydration.md, fever.md for specific management

TODDLERS (1-3 YEARS):
- May not be able to communicate clearly
- Fear and distress affect assessment - reassure caregiver
- Need reassurance during treatment
- Dosages based on weight
- Watch for signs of serious illness (see vital signs)

CHILDREN (4-12 YEARS):
- Can sometimes communicate but may be frightened
- Still need weight-based dosages
- May be frightened - reassurance helps
- Can sometimes describe symptoms

ADOLESCENTS (13-17 YEARS):
- Closer to adult dosages but still calculate
- May be able to communicate well
- Still need careful dosing
- Consider emotional needs

FEVER IN CHILDREN:
- Children get fevers more easily than adults
- Febrile seizures are common (usually not dangerous)
- Keep child cool and hydrated
- See fever.md for management
- Do NOT overdress child
- Watch for signs of serious illness (see vital signs)

DEHYDRATION IN CHILDREN:
- Children dehydrate faster than adults
- Watch for: No tears when crying, sunken fontanelle (infants), dry mouth
- Begin rehydration immediately
- See dehydration.md for management
- Oral rehydration solution is critical (WHO IMCI standard)

RESPIRATORY ILLNESS IN CHILDREN:
- Children have smaller airways - obstruction is more dangerous
- Respiratory problems can worsen rapidly
- Monitor breathing closely (see vital signs)
- See respiratory_illness.md
- Position for comfort

VITAL SIGNS TO CHECK:

RESPIRATORY RATE (BREATHS PER MINUTE):
- Newborn (0-1 month): 30-60 (normal)
- Infant (1-12 months): 30-50 (normal)
- Toddler (1-3 years): 24-40 (normal)
- Child (4-12 years): 20-30 (normal)
- Adolescent (13-17 years): 16-20 (normal)
- Count for full minute if possible
- Rapid breathing indicates distress or illness

HEART RATE (BEATS PER MINUTE):
- Newborn (0-1 month): 100-180 (normal)
- Infant (1-12 months): 100-160 (normal)
- Toddler (1-3 years): 90-150 (normal)
- Child (4-12 years): 70-120 (normal)
- Adolescent (13-17 years): 60-100 (normal)
- Rapid weak pulse indicates shock or serious illness

TEMPERATURE:
- Normal: 98.6°F (37°C) - same as adults
- Fever: Above 100.4°F (38°C)
- High fever: Above 104°F (40°C) - dangerous
- Infants under 3 months: Any fever is serious

CONSCIOUSNESS (AVPU):
- Alert: Normal
- Voice: Responds to voice - monitor closely
- Pain: Responds only to pain - serious
- Unresponsive: Life-threatening

DEHYDRATION SIGNS:
- Fontanelle (infants): Sunken = severe dehydration
- Tears: No tears when crying = dehydration
- Urine: Dark yellow or no urine = dehydration
- Skin: Dry, poor elasticity = dehydration
- Mouth: Dry, no saliva = dehydration
