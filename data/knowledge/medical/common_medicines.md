TITLE: Common Medicines - Usage and Dosages

KEYWORDS: medication, dosage, paracetamol, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, ORS, antiseptic, pain relief, fever reduction

SEVERITY LEVELS:
- Safe use: Following proper dosages and guidelines
- Risky: Exceeding dosages, combining incorrectly, using contraindicated
- Dangerous: Overdose, wrong medication, giving to wrong person

WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE:
- Person needs pain relief
- Person has fever
- Person has inflammation or swelling
- Person is dehydrated
- Wound needs cleaning
- Before giving any medication

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Overdose can cause liver failure, kidney failure, or death
- Wrong medication can cause serious harm
- Combining medications incorrectly can be dangerous
- Giving to children or elderly requires different dosages
- Some medications are contraindicated in certain conditions

STEP-BY-STEP ACTIONS (DO THIS IN ORDER):

1. IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM:
   - What symptom needs treatment?
   - Is medication appropriate or can other methods work?
   - What is the underlying cause?

2. CHECK CONTRAINDICATIONS:
   - Does person have conditions that make medication unsafe?
   - Is person taking other medications?
   - Is person allergic to medication?
   - Is person pregnant or breastfeeding?
   - See specific medication sections below

3. CALCULATE CORRECT DOSAGE:
   - Use weight for children (most accurate)
   - Use age if weight unknown (less accurate)
   - Do NOT guess - better to give less than more
   - See dosage tables below

4. ADMINISTER SAFELY:
   - Give with food if stomach upset possible
   - Give with water
   - Do NOT crush tablets unless directed
   - Do NOT mix with alcohol

5. MONITOR FOR SIDE EFFECTS:
   - Watch for allergic reactions
   - Watch for worsening symptoms
   - Stop if serious side effects occur
   - MEDICATION INTERACTIONS (CRITICAL):
     * Do NOT combine paracetamol with other paracetamol-containing medicines
     * Do NOT combine ibuprofen with aspirin (increases bleeding risk)
     * Do NOT combine multiple pain medicines without knowing interactions
     * Alcohol increases risk with many medicines
     * Some medicines affect blood clotting - do not combine
   - OVERDOSE RECOGNITION:
     * Paracetamol overdose: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, liver damage (may not show for 24-48 hours)
     * Ibuprofen overdose: Stomach pain, nausea, dizziness, kidney problems
     * If overdose suspected: Stop medication, monitor closely
     * Some overdoses may not show symptoms immediately
     * When in doubt: Give less, not more

IMPROVISED / LOW-RESOURCE OPTIONS:

NO MEASURING TOOLS:

- Better to give less than more
- Do NOT guess - errors can be fatal

NO SPECIFIC MEDICINE:
- Focus on other treatments (rest, hydration, positioning)
- Some conditions do not require medication
- Natural methods may help (cooling for fever, etc.)

CALCULATING CHILD DOSAGES:

IF YOU KNOW WEIGHT:
- Most accurate method
- Use formulas provided above
- Example: 20kg child, paracetamol = 20kg × 10-15mg = 200-300mg per dose

IF YOU DO NOT KNOW WEIGHT:
- Use age-based dosing (less accurate)
- Better to give less than more
- If unsure: Do not give, or give minimum dose

WEIGHT ESTIMATION (ROUGH):
- Average weights (approximate):
  * 1 year: 10kg
  * 2 years: 12kg
  * 5 years: 18kg
  * 10 years: 32kg
  * 15 years: 50kg
- These are rough estimates - use with caution

WHEN YOU MUST SEEK PROFESSIONAL HELP:
- Overdose suspected
- Serious side effects
- Medication not helping
- Person requires prescription medication
- Complex medical conditions
- Pregnancy or breastfeeding concerns

REALISTIC OUTCOMES & LIMITATIONS:

WITH PROPER USE:
- Medications can help with symptoms
- Proper dosages are generally safe
- Can improve comfort and recovery

WITHOUT PROFESSIONAL HELP:
- Some conditions require prescription medications (not available)
- Dosage errors can cause harm
- Some medications may not be available
- Focus on what is available and safe

SAFETY & ACCURACY RULES:

MEDICAL REASONING:
- Weight-based dosing is most accurate for children
- Maximum dosages prevent overdose
- Contraindications prevent serious harm
- Monitoring helps catch problems early

CLEAN VS DIRTY VS LAST-RESORT:
- Clean: Proper medications, accurate dosages, measuring tools (ideal)
- Dirty: Available medications, estimated dosages (acceptable if careful)
- Last-resort: Focus on non-medication treatments if medications unavailable or unsafe

MYTHS CORRECTED:
- "More is better" - FALSE: Overdose is dangerous
- "Natural means safe" - FALSE: Natural substances can be toxic
- "Children are small adults" - FALSE: Children need different dosages

STORAGE:
- Keep medicines in cool, dry place
- Keep out of reach of children
- Check expiration dates
- Do not use if expired or unknown
- STORAGE CONDITIONS:
  * Most medicines: Room temperature, dry place
  * Protect from light and moisture
  * Do not store in bathroom (humidity)
  * Do not store in car (heat)
  * Keep in original container if possible
  * Label clearly if removed from original container
  * Check for signs of deterioration (color change, crumbling)
- EXPIRATION:
  * Expired medicines may be less effective
  * Some expired medicines can be harmful
  * When in doubt: Do not use
  * In survival situation: May need to use expired medicines if nothing else available
  * Use with extra caution if expired
