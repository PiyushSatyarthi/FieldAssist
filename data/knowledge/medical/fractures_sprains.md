TITLE: Fractures, Dislocations, and Sprains

KEYWORDS: fracture, broken bone, dislocation, sprain, immobilization, splint, deformity

SEVERITY LEVELS:
- Mild: Sprain - pain, swelling, but no deformity, can bear weight
- Serious: Fracture - deformity, cannot use limb, severe pain
- Life-threatening: Open fracture with bleeding, fracture with neurovascular compromise, multiple fractures

WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE:
- Severe pain after injury
- Visible deformity or abnormal position
- Inability to move or use limb normally
- Swelling and bruising after injury
- Bone visible through skin (open fracture)
- Joint appears dislocated
- Person heard or felt bone break

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Open fractures can cause severe bleeding and infection
- Fractures can damage nerves and blood vessels
- Moving fractured limb can cause more damage
- Multiple fractures can cause shock
- Time is critical for open fractures (infection risk)

STEP-BY-STEP ACTIONS (DO THIS IN ORDER):

1. ASSESS THE INJURY:
   - Check for bleeding (see bleeding.md if present)
   - Check for deformity or abnormal position
   - Check for open wound (bone visible)
   - Check for pulse and sensation below injury
   - Check for ability to move fingers/toes
   - Do NOT move injured area to assess

2. CONTROL BLEEDING (IF OPEN FRACTURE):
   - Open fractures bleed heavily
   - Apply direct pressure around wound (not directly on bone)
   - Do NOT push bone back in
   - Cover wound with clean material
   - See bleeding.md for complete bleeding control

3. IMMOBILIZE THE INJURY:
   - Do NOT try to straighten or realign
   - Immobilize in position found
   - Use splint to prevent movement
   - Splint should include joint above and below injury
   - Example: Forearm fracture - splint from above elbow to hand

4. IMPROVISED SPLINTING:
   - Materials: Sticks, boards, rolled newspaper, folded clothing
   - Pad splint with cloth to prevent pressure points
   - Place splint along injured limb
   - Secure with bandages, cloth strips, or whatever available
   - Tie firmly but not so tight it cuts off circulation
   - Check fingers/toes for color, warmth, and sensation after splinting

5. ELEVATE IF POSSIBLE:
   - Elevate injured limb to reduce swelling
   - Do NOT elevate if it causes more pain
   - Support limb in comfortable position

6. APPLY COLD IF AVAILABLE:
   - Cold reduces swelling and pain
   - Use cold compress (not ice directly)
   - Apply for 15-20 minutes at a time
   - Do NOT apply cold directly to skin (wrap in cloth)

7. MONITOR FOR COMPLICATIONS:
   - Check pulse and sensation below injury regularly
   - Watch for signs of compartment syndrome:
     * Severe pain that worsens
     * Numbness or tingling
     * Pale or cold skin
     * Inability to move fingers/toes
   - Watch for signs of shock (see shock.md)

WHAT NOT TO DO:
- DO NOT try to straighten or realign bones
- DO NOT push bone back in if open fracture
- DO NOT test range of motion
- DO NOT massage the area
- DO NOT allow person to use injured limb
- DO NOT make splint too tight (cuts off circulation)
- DO NOT remove splint to check injury
- DO NOT give person anything to eat/drink if may need surgery

IMPROVISED / LOW-RESOURCE OPTIONS:

NO SPLINT MATERIALS:
- Use clothing to wrap and support
- Use person's body as splint (tie injured leg to good leg)
- Use whatever rigid material available
- Even soft support is better than nothing

NO BANDAGES:
- Use torn clothing, strips of fabric
- Use belts, shoelaces, rope
- Tie securely but check circulation
- Multiple layers if needed

SPLINTING TECHNIQUES:

FOREARM/WRIST:
- Splint from above elbow to hand
- Support wrist in neutral position
- Use sling to support arm

UPPER ARM:
- Splint from shoulder to elbow
- Bind arm to body
- Use sling for support

LEG/ANKLE:
- Splint from above knee to foot
- Support ankle at 90 degrees
- Do NOT allow foot to drop

THIGH:
- Splint from hip to below knee
- Very difficult to splint properly
- Bind injured leg to good leg if nothing else available

DISLOCATIONS:
- Do NOT try to reduce (put back in place) without training
- Immobilize in position found
- Splint as for fracture
- Reduction without training can cause more damage

WHEN YOU MUST SEEK PROFESSIONAL HELP:
- Open fracture (bone visible)
- Loss of pulse or sensation below injury
- Multiple fractures
- Fracture with signs of compartment syndrome
- Dislocation that cannot be reduced
- Person requires surgery or casting (not available)
- Fracture does not heal properly

REALISTIC OUTCOMES & LIMITATIONS:

WITH PROPER CARE:
- Sprains usually heal in 1-2 weeks
- Simple fractures may heal with proper immobilization (6-8 weeks)
- Proper splinting prevents further damage
- Some function may be lost

WITHOUT PROFESSIONAL HELP:
- Some fractures require surgery (not available)
- Malunion (healing in wrong position) is likely without proper alignment
- Some fractures may not heal (nonunion)
- Permanent disability is possible
- Infection risk with open fractures

LONG-TERM:
- Fractures take 6-8 weeks minimum to heal
- May take months for full strength
- Some permanent stiffness or limitation
- Monitor for complications
- May require ongoing care

SAFETY & ACCURACY RULES:

MEDICAL REASONING:
- Immobilization prevents further damage and reduces pain
- Splinting above and below prevents movement at fracture site
- Checking circulation prevents compartment syndrome
- Elevation reduces swelling

CLEAN VS DIRTY VS LAST-RESORT:
- Clean: Proper splints, sterile dressings (ideal but unavailable)
- Dirty: Improvised materials, cleanest available (acceptable)
- Last-resort: Whatever prevents movement (better than nothing)

MYTHS CORRECTED:
- "Straighten the bone" - FALSE: Causes more damage
- "Walk it off" - FALSE: Can worsen fracture
- "All fractures need surgery" - FALSE: Many heal with immobilization

SPRAINS VS FRACTURES:

SPRAINS:
- Ligament injury
- Pain, swelling, but usually no deformity
- May be able to bear weight
- Usually heals with rest and support

FRACTURES:
- Bone break
- Deformity, severe pain, cannot use limb
- Requires immobilization
- Takes longer to heal
