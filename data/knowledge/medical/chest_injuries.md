TITLE: Chest Injuries and Breathing Emergencies

KEYWORDS: chest injury, pneumothorax, sucking chest wound, flail chest, rib fracture, difficulty breathing, chest pain

SEVERITY LEVELS:
- Mild: Pain with breathing, minor rib injury
- Serious: Difficulty breathing, visible chest deformity, open wound
- Life-threatening: Cannot breathe, sucking chest wound, severe difficulty breathing, loss of consciousness

WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE:
- Penetrating chest injury (knife, bullet, impalement)
- Blunt chest trauma (fall, impact, crush)
- Person has difficulty breathing after chest injury
- Open wound on chest with air being sucked in
- Chest deformity or asymmetry
- Severe chest pain that worsens with breathing
- Coughing up blood

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Collapsed lung (pneumothorax) can cause death within minutes
- Tension pneumothorax (air trapped in chest) is immediately life-threatening
- Sucking chest wound allows air into chest cavity, collapsing lung
- Multiple rib fractures can cause flail chest (unstable chest wall)
- Internal bleeding in chest cannot be controlled externally

STEP-BY-STEP ACTIONS (DO THIS IN ORDER):

1. ASSESS BREATHING AND CONSCIOUSNESS:
   - Check if person is breathing
   - Check if person can speak
   - Look for signs of difficulty breathing (rapid, shallow, labored)
   - Check for open wounds on chest
   - Listen for air being sucked into wound (sucking sound)

2. SUCKING CHEST WOUND (OPEN PNEUMOTHORAX):
   - Identify: Open wound on chest, air being sucked in with each breath
   - Cover wound immediately with airtight material:
     * Plastic bag, foil, or waterproof material
     * If nothing else: Use hand or clothing
   - Seal on THREE SIDES ONLY (leave one corner open)
   - This allows air to escape but prevents air from entering
   - Tape or tie material in place if possible
   - Monitor: If person's breathing worsens, remove seal temporarily
   - Do NOT seal completely on all sides (can cause tension pneumothorax)

3. POSITION THE PERSON:
   - Keep person sitting up or semi-sitting if conscious
   - Lying flat makes breathing more difficult
   - If unconscious: Position on injured side (allows good lung to work)
   - Support person in comfortable position

4. IMMOBILIZE IF NECESSARY:
   - If multiple rib fractures suspected: Wrap chest loosely with bandage
   - Do NOT wrap tightly (restricts breathing)
   - Support injured side
   - Minimize movement

5. MONITOR BREATHING:
   - Watch for worsening difficulty breathing
   - Check both sides of chest rise equally
   - Listen for breath sounds (if trained)
   - Watch for signs of tension pneumothorax:
     * Worsening difficulty breathing
     * Bulging on one side of chest
     * Distended neck veins
     * Shift of trachea to one side (feel for deviation from center)
     * One side of chest not moving
     * Person becomes very distressed
   - TENSION PNEUMOTHORAX IS LIFE-THREATENING:
     * Develops when air is trapped in chest
     * Compresses heart and other lung
     * Can cause death within minutes
     * Requires immediate attention

6. IF TENSION PNEUMOTHORAX DEVELOPS:
   - This is life-threatening emergency
   - Air is trapped in chest, compressing heart and other lung
   - Needle decompression may be needed (advanced procedure, high risk)
   - In austere setting: May need to release seal on wound temporarily
   - Monitor closely - this can be fatal

7. TREAT SHOCK:
   - Chest injuries can cause significant blood loss
   - Monitor for signs of shock (see shock.md)
   - Keep person warm
   - Do not give fluids if person may need surgery

WHAT NOT TO DO:
- DO NOT remove impaled objects (stabilize in place)
- DO NOT seal sucking chest wound completely on all sides
- DO NOT wrap chest tightly (restricts breathing)
- DO NOT lay person flat if having difficulty breathing
- DO NOT give fluids if person may need surgery
- DO NOT attempt needle decompression without training (can cause more harm)
- DO NOT ignore worsening breathing
- DO NOT move person unnecessarily if multiple injuries

IMPROVISED / LOW-RESOURCE OPTIONS:

NO AIRTIGHT MATERIAL:
- Use hand to cover wound temporarily
- Use clothing (less effective but better than nothing)
- Look for plastic, foil, or waterproof materials
- Even partial coverage helps

NO TAPE OR BANDAGES:
- Hold material in place by hand
- Use clothing to tie around chest (loosely)
- Have another person help hold if available
- Priority is covering wound, not perfect seal

MONITORING WITHOUT EQUIPMENT:
- Watch chest movement (both sides should move)
- Listen for breath sounds
- Watch person's color (blue/gray indicates severe problem)
- Feel for air movement from wound
- Monitor level of consciousness

POSITIONING:
- Use whatever available to prop person up
- Rocks, logs, backpacks can support person
- Keep person comfortable but breathing as priority

WHEN YOU MUST SEEK PROFESSIONAL HELP:
- Person cannot breathe or breathing is severely compromised
- Sucking chest wound that cannot be sealed
- Tension pneumothorax developing
- Severe internal bleeding suspected
- Multiple rib fractures with flail chest
- Person loses consciousness
- Requires chest tube or surgical intervention (not available in austere settings)

REALISTIC OUTCOMES & LIMITATIONS:

WITH PROPER CARE:
- Minor rib fractures heal with rest and pain management
- Sucking chest wounds can be managed with proper sealing
- Some chest injuries require surgical intervention
- Recovery may take weeks to months

WITHOUT PROFESSIONAL HELP:
- Tension pneumothorax may be fatal without needle decompression
- Severe internal bleeding cannot be controlled externally
- Some injuries require chest tubes (not available)
- Person may die despite best efforts

LONG-TERM:
- Rib fractures take 6-8 weeks to heal
- Person needs rest and pain management
- Monitor for complications (pneumonia, infection)
- May have permanent breathing difficulties

SAFETY & ACCURACY RULES:

MEDICAL REASONING:
- Sucking chest wound allows air into pleural space, collapsing lung
- Three-sided seal allows air to escape but prevents entry
- Tension pneumothorax occurs when air is trapped, compressing heart
- Sitting position helps breathing by reducing pressure on lungs

CLEAN VS DIRTY VS LAST-RESORT:
- Clean: Sterile occlusive dressing (ideal but unavailable)
- Dirty: Clean plastic or foil (acceptable)
- Last-resort: Hand or clothing (better than nothing)

MYTHS CORRECTED:
- "Remove impaled objects" - FALSE: Stabilize in place, removal can cause more bleeding
- "Wrap chest tightly" - FALSE: Restricts breathing, can worsen condition
- "All chest wounds are fatal" - FALSE: Many can be managed with proper care

TYPES OF CHEST INJURIES:

PNEUMOTHORAX (COLLAPSED LUNG):
- Air in pleural space
- Can be open (sucking wound) or closed
- Treat by sealing wound if open
- May require chest tube (not available in austere settings)

TENSION PNEUMOTHORAX:
- Air trapped in chest, compressing heart
- Life-threatening emergency
- Requires needle decompression ideally (advanced procedure)
- Can be fatal within minutes

HEMOTHORAX (BLOOD IN CHEST):
- Internal bleeding in chest cavity
- Cannot be controlled externally
- Monitor for shock
- May require surgical intervention

FLAIL CHEST:
- Multiple rib fractures, unstable chest wall
- Paradoxical movement (injured area moves opposite to rest of chest)
- Support with loose bandaging
- Monitor breathing closely

RIB FRACTURES:
- Pain with breathing
- May cause difficulty breathing
- Usually heal with rest
- Pain management important
