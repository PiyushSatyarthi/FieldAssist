TITLE: Head and Spinal Trauma

KEYWORDS: head injury, concussion, spinal injury, neck injury, brain injury, loss of consciousness, paralysis

SEVERITY LEVELS:
- Mild: Brief loss of consciousness, headache, no neurological deficits
- Serious: Prolonged unconsciousness, confusion, neurological symptoms, suspected spinal injury
- Life-threatening: Severe head injury, brain herniation, complete spinal cord injury, respiratory arrest

WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE:
- Head injury with loss of consciousness (even brief)
- Head injury with confusion or memory loss
- Head injury with bleeding from ears, nose, or clear fluid from nose/ears
- Suspected neck or back injury
- Person cannot move limbs after injury
- Person has numbness or tingling after injury
- Fall from height, motor vehicle crash, or significant trauma

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Brain injury can cause permanent damage or death
- Spinal injury can cause permanent paralysis
- Moving person with spinal injury can worsen damage
- Intracranial bleeding can cause brain herniation and death
- Time is critical: Immobilize immediately, do not move unnecessarily

STEP-BY-STEP ACTIONS (DO THIS IN ORDER):

1. ASSESS CONSCIOUSNESS AND BREATHING:
   - Check if person responds to voice or touch
   - Check breathing and pulse
   - If not breathing: Begin rescue breathing (see airway_obstruction.md)
   - Do NOT move head or neck to check breathing
   - Maintain head and neck in neutral position

2. IMMOBILIZE HEAD AND NECK:
   - Assume spinal injury until proven otherwise
   - Do NOT move head, neck, or back
   - If person is conscious: Tell them not to move
   - Support head and neck in position found
   - Use hands to stabilize head (one person should do this continuously)
   - Do NOT tilt head back for airway (use jaw-thrust if needed)

3. ASSESS NEUROLOGICAL FUNCTION:
   - Ask person to move fingers and toes (if conscious)
   - Check for sensation (can they feel touch?)
   - Check for paralysis or weakness
   - Note any numbness or tingling
   - Check pupils if possible (should be equal and reactive)
   - Unequal pupils indicate serious brain injury

4. CONTROL BLEEDING (IF PRESENT):
   - Head wounds bleed heavily but are rarely fatal from bleeding alone
   - Apply direct pressure with clean material
   - Do NOT move head to control bleeding
   - Do NOT remove embedded objects
   - Monitor for signs of brain injury

5. MONITOR CONSCIOUSNESS:
   - Use AVPU scale:
     * Alert: Person is awake and aware
     * Voice: Responds to voice
     * Pain: Responds only to pain
     * Unresponsive: No response
   - Check every few minutes
   - Worsening consciousness indicates serious problem
   - GLASGOW COMA SCALE (BASIC ASSESSMENT):
     * Eye opening: Spontaneous (4), To voice (3), To pain (2), None (1)
     * Verbal response: Oriented (5), Confused (4), Inappropriate words (3), Incomprehensible (2), None (1)
     * Motor response: Obeys commands (6), Localizes pain (5), Withdraws from pain (4), Abnormal flexion (3), Extension (2), None (1)
     * Score 13-15: Mild injury
     * Score 9-12: Moderate injury
     * Score 3-8: Severe injury (life-threatening)
   - INCREASED INTRACRANIAL PRESSURE SIGNS:
     * Worsening consciousness
     * Unequal pupils
     * Abnormal breathing patterns
     * High blood pressure with slow pulse (Cushing's triad - late sign)
     * These indicate brain herniation risk - life-threatening

6. POSITIONING:
   - Keep person flat and still
   - Do NOT elevate head (unless having difficulty breathing)
   - If person must vomit: Log-roll entire body as one unit
   - Support head and neck during any movement
   - Do NOT allow person to sit up

7. PREVENT HYPOTHERMIA:
   - Cover person with blankets or clothing
   - Keep warm but not overheated
   - Head injury can affect temperature regulation

WHAT NOT TO DO:
- DO NOT move head, neck, or back
- DO NOT tilt head back for airway (use jaw-thrust)
- DO NOT allow person to sit up or move
- DO NOT remove helmet if present (stabilizes head, remove only if obstructing airway)
- DO NOT give fluids if person may have brain injury (aspiration risk, may need surgery)
- DO NOT ignore loss of consciousness, even if brief
- DO NOT assume person is fine because they "walked it off"
- DO NOT move person unless absolutely necessary (danger, fire, etc.)

IMPROVISED / LOW-RESOURCE OPTIONS:

NO CERVICAL COLLAR:
- Use hands to stabilize head continuously
- Have one person dedicated to head stabilization
- Use rolled clothing or towels around head (do not move head to place)
- Improvised collar from cardboard or similar (advanced, risky)

NO BACKBOARD:
- Keep person on ground, do not move
- If must move: Log-roll as one unit
- Use flat board, door, or similar if available
- Multiple people needed to move safely

IMMOBILIZATION:
- Use clothing, blankets, or whatever available to pad around person
- Prevent movement, do not try to "straighten" person
- Support head and neck continuously
- Keep person still and calm

MONITORING WITHOUT EQUIPMENT:
- Check consciousness by talking to person
- Check movement by asking person to move fingers/toes
- Check pupils with light if available
- Monitor breathing and pulse
- Watch for changes in condition

WHEN YOU MUST SEEK PROFESSIONAL HELP:
- Loss of consciousness (even brief)
- Worsening consciousness or confusion
- Unequal pupils
- Clear fluid from nose or ears (cerebrospinal fluid leak)
- Paralysis or inability to move limbs
- Severe headache or neurological symptoms
- Person requires imaging or surgical intervention (not available)
- Signs of brain herniation (deteriorating consciousness, abnormal breathing)

REALISTIC OUTCOMES & LIMITATIONS:

WITH PROPER CARE:
- Minor head injuries (concussions) usually recover fully
- Proper immobilization prevents worsening of spinal injuries
- Some injuries require surgical intervention
- Recovery may take weeks to months or may be permanent

WITHOUT PROFESSIONAL HELP:
- Intracranial bleeding cannot be controlled without surgery
- Spinal cord injuries are usually permanent
- Some brain injuries cause permanent damage
- Person may die despite best efforts

LONG-TERM:
- Concussions may cause ongoing symptoms (headaches, memory problems)
- Spinal injuries may cause permanent paralysis
- Person needs ongoing care and support
- Recovery varies greatly depending on injury

SAFETY & ACCURACY RULES:

MEDICAL REASONING:
- Spinal cord injury can be worsened by movement
- Head injury can cause bleeding inside skull, increasing pressure
- Immobilization prevents secondary injury
- Time is critical - damage may be permanent

CLEAN VS DIRTY VS LAST-RESORT:
- Clean: Proper cervical collar and backboard (ideal but unavailable)
- Dirty: Hand stabilization, improvised materials (acceptable)
- Last-resort: Minimal movement, keep still (better than moving incorrectly)

MYTHS CORRECTED:
- "Keep person awake after head injury" - FALSE: Rest is important, but monitor consciousness
- "Move person to comfortable position" - FALSE: Keep in position found if spinal injury suspected
- "Person is fine if they can walk" - FALSE: Serious injuries may not show immediately

SIGNS OF SERIOUS HEAD INJURY:
- Loss of consciousness
- Confusion or memory loss
- Severe headache
- Nausea or vomiting
- Seizures
- Unequal pupils
- Clear fluid from nose/ears
- Weakness or numbness
- Slurred speech

SIGNS OF SPINAL INJURY:
- Pain in neck or back
- Inability to move limbs
- Numbness or tingling
- Loss of sensation
- Difficulty breathing
- Loss of bladder/bowel control

CONCUSSION MANAGEMENT:
- Rest is primary treatment
- Monitor for worsening symptoms
- Avoid activities that could cause another injury
- Most resolve in days to weeks
- Some may have persistent symptoms
