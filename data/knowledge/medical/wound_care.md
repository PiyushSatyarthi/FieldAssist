TITLE: Wound Care and Dressing

KEYWORDS: wound, laceration, cut, abrasion, dressing, bandage, wound cleaning, infection prevention

SEVERITY LEVELS:
- Mild: Small cut or scrape, minimal bleeding, clean edges
- Serious: Deep wound, gaping edges, significant tissue damage
- Life-threatening: Large wound with severe bleeding, major tissue loss, arterial bleeding

WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE:
- Cut, scrape, or open skin injury
- Bleeding has stopped or is controlled
- Wound needs cleaning and dressing
- Preventing infection is priority
- Wound is not actively bleeding heavily (see bleeding.md first)

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Infection can develop within hours
- Improper cleaning can introduce bacteria
- Tight closure can trap infection
- Some wounds require stitches (may not be available)
- Time is important: Clean within first few hours if possible

STEP-BY-STEP ACTIONS (DO THIS IN ORDER):

1. WASH YOUR HANDS:
   - Clean hands reduce infection risk
   - Use soap and water if available
   - Use cleanest water available
   - Do this before touching wound

2. CONTROL BLEEDING (IF STILL BLEEDING):
   - Apply direct pressure with clean material
   - Maintain pressure for 10-15 minutes
   - See bleeding.md if bleeding is severe
   - Do NOT proceed with cleaning if actively bleeding heavily

3. CLEAN THE WOUND:
   - Use clean, running water if available
   - Pour water over wound to remove dirt and debris
   - Gently flush wound - do NOT scrub deep inside
   - Remove visible debris with clean tweezers if available (sterilize first)
   - Do NOT use soap directly in wound (irritates tissue)
   - Continue until wound appears clean

4. CLEAN SURROUNDING SKIN:
   - Wash skin around wound with soap and water
   - Rinse thoroughly
   - Apply antiseptic to surrounding skin (not deep in wound)
   - See common_medicines.md for antiseptic options

5. ASSESS THE WOUND:
   - Check depth and size
   - Check for embedded objects (do not remove)
   - Check for signs of serious injury (tendon, nerve, vessel damage)
   - Decide if wound needs closure

6. DRESS THE WOUND:
   - Use clean, non-stick material
   - Cover wound completely
   - Secure with bandage or tape
   - Do NOT wrap too tightly (needs some circulation)
   - Change dressing daily or when wet/dirty

7. MONITOR FOR INFECTION:
   - Check wound daily
   - Watch for signs of infection (see below)
   - Keep wound clean and dry
   - See wound_infection_management.md if infection develops

WHAT NOT TO DO:
- DO NOT scrub deep inside wound (damages tissue)
- DO NOT use hydrogen peroxide deep in wound (damages tissue)
- DO NOT tightly close deep or wide wounds (traps infection)
- DO NOT use dirty materials
- DO NOT ignore signs of infection
- DO NOT remove embedded objects (stabilize in place)
- DO NOT use butter, oil, or unknown substances

IMPROVISED / LOW-RESOURCE OPTIONS:

NO CLEAN WATER:
- Use cleanest water available
- Boil water if possible, then let cool
- Filter water through clean cloth if very dirty
- In emergency: Use available water - cleaning is priority

NO CLEAN CLOTH:
- Use cleanest fabric available
- Boil cloth if possible
- Tear clean clothing into strips
- If nothing clean: Use whatever available - better than leaving open

NO BANDAGES:
- Use torn clothing, strips of fabric
- Use tape if available
- Tie securely but not too tight
- Multiple layers if needed

NO ANTISEPTIC:
- Clean water is most important
- Soap on surrounding skin helps
- Focus on thorough cleaning
- Keep wound covered

WOUND CLOSURE:

WHEN TO CLOSE:
- Clean, recent wounds (within 6-8 hours)
- Wounds with clean edges that come together easily
- Small wounds that gap open

WHEN NOT TO CLOSE:
- Dirty wounds
- Wounds older than 8-12 hours
- Bite wounds (high infection risk)
- Wounds with signs of infection
- Deep wounds that cannot be cleaned thoroughly

IMPROVISED CLOSURE:
- Steri-strips or tape if available
- Butterfly bandages (can be made from tape)
- Do NOT use regular thread or sewing (high infection risk)
- If closure attempted: Keep very clean, monitor closely

SUTURING (ADVANCED - HIGH RISK):
- Requires training and sterile technique
- High infection risk if done incorrectly
- Better to leave open if unsure
- Only attempt if wound is life-threatening and no other option

WHEN YOU MUST SEEK PROFESSIONAL HELP:
- Large or deep wounds requiring stitches
- Wounds with embedded objects
- Signs of serious injury (tendon, nerve damage)
- Wounds that become infected
- Wounds that do not heal
- Requires surgical closure (not available)

REALISTIC OUTCOMES & LIMITATIONS:

WITH PROPER CARE:
- Most wounds heal in 1-2 weeks
- Proper cleaning reduces infection risk
- Small wounds usually heal without problems
- Some scarring is normal

WITHOUT PROFESSIONAL HELP:
- Some wounds require stitches (may not heal properly without)
- Infection risk is higher
- Some wounds may not heal
- Scarring may be more significant
- Some function may be lost

LONG-TERM:
- Wounds heal from edges inward
- May take weeks for full healing
- Monitor for complications
- Some wounds require ongoing care

SAFETY & ACCURACY RULES:

MEDICAL REASONING:
- Cleaning removes bacteria and debris
- Proper dressing protects wound and keeps it clean
- Tight closure traps bacteria and prevents drainage
- Time is important - clean early reduces infection risk

CLEAN VS DIRTY VS LAST-RESORT:
- Clean: Sterile materials, proper technique (ideal but unavailable)
- Dirty: Cleanest available materials (acceptable)
- Last-resort: Whatever prevents contamination (better than leaving open)

MYTHS CORRECTED:
- "Let it air out" - FALSE: Covered wounds heal faster and have less infection
- "Butter on wounds" - FALSE: Traps bacteria, increases infection
- "Tight closure is best" - FALSE: Traps infection, prevents drainage

TYPES OF WOUNDS:

LACERATIONS (CUTS):
- Clean edges
- May need closure
- Usually heal well if clean

ABRASIONS (SCRAPES):
- Superficial
- Usually heal without closure
- Keep clean and covered

PUNCTURES:
- Deep, narrow
- High infection risk
- Do NOT close - allow to drain
- Monitor closely

AVULSIONS (TISSUE LOSS):
- Missing tissue
- Cannot be closed
- Heals from edges
- May require grafting (not available)
