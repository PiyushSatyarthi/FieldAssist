TITLE: Long-Term Wound Care

KEYWORDS: wound healing, chronic wound, slow healing, wound care, dressing changes, wound management

SEVERITY LEVELS:
- Mild: Wound healing normally, minimal care needed
- Serious: Wound healing slowly, requires ongoing care, some complications
- Life-threatening: Wound not healing, severe infection, tissue death, sepsis risk

WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE:
- Open wound healing slowly (days to weeks)
- Wound requiring ongoing care
- No access to medical care
- No antibiotics available
- Wound not closing or healing

IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES:
1. Prevent infection - Ongoing risk
2. Support healing - Proper care helps
3. Monitor closely - Watch for complications
4. Maintain function - Prevent disability

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Infection can develop at any time
- Wounds that do not heal may indicate serious problems
- Tissue death can occur
- Sepsis risk if infection spreads
- Time and proper care are critical

STEP-BY-STEP TREATMENT:

1. DAILY CLEANING:
   - Wash hands thoroughly before touching wound
   - Rinse wound gently with clean water
   - Do NOT scrub (damages new tissue)
   - Remove any loose debris
   - Clean surrounding skin

2. ALLOW DRAINAGE:
   - Do NOT seal wound tightly
   - Allow fluid to drain if present
   - Cover lightly with clean cloth
   - Change dressing when wet or dirty
   - Airflow helps healing

3. DRESSING CHANGES:
   - Change dressing daily minimum
   - Change more often if wet or dirty
   - Use clean, non-stick material
   - Cover loosely - do not seal
   - Monitor wound during changes

4. MONITOR HEALING:
   - Check wound daily
   - Look for signs of improvement
   - Watch for signs of infection
   - Note any changes
   - Document if possible

5. SUPPORT HEALING:
   - Ensure adequate nutrition
   - Stay hydrated
   - Rest helps healing
   - Protect wound from further injury
   - Keep wound elevated if possible

FOR SPECIFIC WOUND TYPES / SPECIAL CASES:

SLOW-HEALING WOUND:
- Some wounds take weeks to months
- Continue care
- Monitor for improvement
- May need different approach
- Some may not heal without medical intervention

CHRONIC WOUND (NOT HEALING):
- Wound not healing after weeks
- May indicate underlying problem
- Continue care
- Monitor closely
- May require medical evaluation (not available)

INFECTED WOUND:
- See wound_infection_management.md
- Requires more frequent cleaning
- May need drainage
- Monitor closely
- Higher risk of complications

BURN WOUND:
- Burns heal slowly
- High infection risk
- Requires careful care
- See burns.md for burn-specific care
- May take weeks to months

PRESSURE SORE:
- Caused by prolonged pressure
- Prevent by changing position
- Keep clean and dry
- Relieve pressure
- Monitor closely

VITAL SIGNS TO CHECK:

HEALING SIGNS (GOOD):
- Wound getting smaller
- New tissue forming (pink/red)
- Minimal drainage
- No signs of infection
- Pain decreasing

INFECTION SIGNS (BAD):
- Increasing redness
- Spreading redness
- Increasing pain
- Pus or foul smell
- Fever
- See wound_infection_management.md

NOT HEALING SIGNS:
- Wound not getting smaller
- No new tissue forming
- Persistent drainage
- Wound edges not coming together
- May indicate underlying problem

TISSUE DEATH SIGNS (DANGEROUS):
- Black or dead tissue
- Strong bad smell
- Wound not healing
- May require debridement (not available)

WHEN PROFESSIONAL HELP IS UNAVAILABLE:

WHAT YOU CAN DO:
- Continue proper wound care
- Monitor closely
- Some wounds will heal with time and care
- Some may require medical intervention that is not available
- Focus on preventing infection and supporting healing

REALITY CHECK:
- Some wounds require surgical intervention (not available)
- Some may not heal without medical care
- Infection risk is ongoing
- Focus on what can be done
- Accept limitations

LONG-TERM CARE:

ONGOING CARE:
- Continue daily cleaning
- Change dressings regularly
- Monitor for complications
- Support healing with nutrition and rest
- Protect from further injury

MONITORING:
- Check wound daily
- Watch for signs of improvement or worsening
- Monitor for infection
- Note any changes
- Adjust care as needed

PREVENTION:

PROPER INITIAL CARE:
- Clean wounds immediately
- Proper initial care reduces long-term problems
- See wound_care.md for initial care
- Prevent infection from start

ONGOING PREVENTION:
- Keep wound clean
- Change dressings regularly
- Protect from further injury
- Support healing with nutrition
- Monitor for complications

REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS:

WITH PROPER CARE:
- Most wounds heal with time and care
- Proper care supports healing
- Some take weeks to months
- Most eventually heal

WITHOUT PROFESSIONAL HELP:
- Some wounds require surgical intervention (not available)
- Some may not heal without medical care
- Infection risk is ongoing
- Focus on what can be done
- Accept limitations

HEALING TIME:
- Small wounds: Days to weeks
- Larger wounds: Weeks to months
- Some may take longer
- Varies greatly

DO NOT:
- DO NOT seal wounds tightly (traps infection, prevents drainage)
- DO NOT ignore increasing pain (indicates infection or problem)
- DO NOT reuse dirty bandages (spreads infection)
- DO NOT stop cleaning (infection will develop)
- DO NOT ignore signs of infection (can be fatal)
- DO NOT ignore tissue death (requires attention)
