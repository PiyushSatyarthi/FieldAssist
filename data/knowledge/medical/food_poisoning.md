TITLE: Food Poisoning Management

KEYWORDS: food poisoning, foodborne illness, vomiting, diarrhea, contaminated food, food safety

SEVERITY LEVELS:
- Mild: Nausea, some vomiting/diarrhea, person alert, can drink
- Serious: Significant vomiting/diarrhea, weakness, difficulty keeping fluids down
- Life-threatening: Severe dehydration, cannot keep fluids down, loss of consciousness, shock

WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE:
- Vomiting and/or diarrhea after eating
- Stomach cramps and nausea after eating
- Multiple people sick after eating same food
- Suspected contaminated food
- Symptoms appear within hours to days of eating

IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES:
1. Preserve life - Dehydration is main killer
2. Begin rehydration immediately - Do not wait
3. Prevent spread - Isolate waste, wash hands
4. Monitor closely - Can worsen rapidly

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Dehydration can kill within days
- Vomiting prevents fluid intake
- Severe dehydration causes shock
- Time is critical - begin rehydration immediately
- Children and elderly are more vulnerable

STEP-BY-STEP TREATMENT:

1. STOP EATING SUSPECTED FOOD:
   - Identify and discard contaminated food
   - Do NOT eat more of the same food
   - Warn others who may have eaten it
   - If possible, save sample for identification (if help available)

2. BEGIN REHYDRATION IMMEDIATELY:
   - Start Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) immediately
   - Vomiting and diarrhea cause rapid fluid loss
   - Give small sips frequently (every 5-10 minutes)
   - Continue despite vomiting - some will be absorbed
   - See dehydration.md for complete rehydration guide

3. IF VOMITING:
   - Give very small amounts of fluid (1-2 teaspoons)
   - Wait 10-15 minutes between attempts
   - Wait 10 minutes after vomiting episode, then resume
   - Continue despite vomiting - some fluid will be absorbed
   - Keep person sitting up or on side to prevent choking

4. IF DIARRHEA:
   - Continue ORS after every loose stool
   - Do NOT stop fluids thinking it will stop diarrhea
   - Diarrhea helps body expel toxins
   - See diarrhea.md for complete guide

5. REST:
   - Body needs energy to fight infection
   - Reduce physical activity
   - Rest in comfortable position
   - Keep person warm if shivering

6. MONITOR CLOSELY:
   - Watch for worsening symptoms
   - Monitor for dehydration signs (see dehydration.md)
   - Check temperature if possible
   - Watch breathing and pulse

FOR SPECIFIC WOUND TYPES / SPECIAL CASES:

BACTERIAL FOOD POISONING:
- Usually from undercooked meat, eggs, dairy
- Symptoms: Diarrhea, vomiting, fever, cramps
- Onset: 6-24 hours
- Duration: 1-3 days usually
- Treatment: Rehydration, rest, time
- May need antibiotics (not available)

VIRAL FOOD POISONING:
- Usually from contaminated food or water
- Symptoms: Vomiting, diarrhea, sometimes fever
- Onset: 12-48 hours
- Duration: 1-3 days usually
- Treatment: Rehydration, rest
- Usually resolves on its own

TOXIN POISONING:
- From spoiled food, certain plants, chemicals
- Onset: Can be very rapid (minutes to hours)
- May cause different symptoms
- Some toxins are very dangerous
- If suspected: Try to identify source

FOOD POISONING IN CHILDREN:
- Children dehydrate faster
- More vulnerable
- Monitor closely
- See child_emergency_care.md for pediatric specifics
- Begin rehydration immediately

FOOD POISONING IN ELDERLY:
- Elderly are more vulnerable
- May not recognize thirst
- Monitor closely
- Begin rehydration immediately

VITAL SIGNS TO CHECK:

VOMITING FREQUENCY:
- Mild: Occasional vomiting
- Moderate: Frequent vomiting
- Severe: Cannot keep anything down (life-threatening)

DIARRHEA:
- Mild: Few loose stools
- Moderate: Multiple loose stools
- Severe: Many loose stools, cannot keep up with losses

DEHYDRATION SIGNS:
- Urine output: Less frequent, dark yellow
- Thirst: Increased or loss of thirst (bad sign)
- Skin: Dry, poor elasticity
- Eyes: Sunken
- Consciousness: Dizzy, weak, confused
- See dehydration.md for complete assessment

FEVER:
- May indicate infection
- Monitor temperature
- See fever.md for management

BREATHING:
- Normal: Regular
- Rapid: May indicate shock or dehydration

PULSE:
- Normal: Regular
- Rapid, weak: May indicate shock or dehydration

WHEN PROFESSIONAL HELP IS UNAVAILABLE:

WHAT YOU CAN DO:
- Continue rehydration efforts
- Keep person comfortable
- Monitor closely
- Most cases resolve on their own
- Some may need medical care that is not available
- Focus on preventing dehydration

REALITY CHECK:
- Most food poisoning resolves in 1-3 days
- Dehydration is the main killer
- Some cases may be more serious
- Without medical care, some complications may not resolve
- Prevention is always better

LONG-TERM CARE:

AFTER RECOVERY:
- Gradually return to normal diet
- Continue adequate hydration
- Monitor for complications
- May take days to fully recover strength

MONITORING:
- Watch for recurrence
- Monitor for complications
- Ensure adequate nutrition during recovery

PREVENTION:

FOOD SAFETY:
- Cook food thoroughly
- Eat freshly cooked food
- Avoid raw or undercooked meat
- Wash hands before handling food
- Store food properly
- Avoid spoiled food

WATER SAFETY:
- Use clean water for cooking
- Boil water if uncertain
- Do NOT use contaminated water in food

RECOGNIZE SPOILED FOOD:
- Bad smell
- Unusual color or texture
- Mold growth
- When in doubt, throw it out

REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS:

WITH PROPER CARE:
- Most food poisoning resolves in 1-3 days
- Proper rehydration prevents most deaths
- Most people recover fully
- Nutrition helps recovery

WITHOUT PROFESSIONAL HELP:
- Some cases may be more serious
- Dehydration is the main killer
- Some may need antibiotics (not available)
- Focus on rehydration and monitoring

DO NOT:
- DO NOT stop fluids to "rest the stomach" (WRONG - causes dehydration)
- DO NOT use anti-diarrheal medicines without knowing cause (can trap infection)
- DO NOT ignore severe symptoms
- DO NOT give alcohol or caffeine (dehydrates)
- DO NOT eat more of suspected food
- DO NOT ignore bloody vomit or stool
- DO NOT wait for severe dehydration before acting
