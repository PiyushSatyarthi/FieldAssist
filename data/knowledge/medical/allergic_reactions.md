TITLE: Allergic Reactions and Anaphylaxis

KEYWORDS: allergic reaction, anaphylaxis, allergy, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing, epinephrine

SEVERITY LEVELS:
- Mild: Hives, itching, minor swelling, no breathing problems
- Serious: Significant swelling, difficulty breathing, but person can still breathe
- Life-threatening: Anaphylaxis - severe difficulty breathing, loss of consciousness, shock

WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE:
- Person develops hives or rash after exposure
- Swelling of face, lips, tongue, or throat
- Difficulty breathing after exposure to allergen
- Person has known severe allergy and is exposed
- Rapid onset of symptoms after eating, medication, or insect sting
- Signs of anaphylaxis (see below)

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Anaphylaxis can cause death within minutes
- Airway swelling can completely block breathing
- Shock can develop rapidly
- Time is critical: Act immediately
- Epinephrine is required for anaphylaxis (may not be available)

STEP-BY-STEP ACTIONS (DO THIS IN ORDER):

1. REMOVE ALLERGEN IF POSSIBLE:
   - Remove stinger if insect sting (scrape, do not squeeze)
   - Remove person from area if environmental allergen
   - Stop medication if drug reaction
   - Do not induce vomiting if food allergen (can worsen airway problems)

2. ASSESS SEVERITY:
   - Mild: Hives, itching, minor swelling, no breathing problems
   - Serious: Swelling of face/throat, some difficulty breathing, but person alert
   - Life-threatening (Anaphylaxis):
     * Severe difficulty breathing or wheezing
     * Swelling of face, lips, tongue, throat
     * Rapid pulse, low blood pressure
     * Hives or rash
     * Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea
     * Loss of consciousness

3. IF ANAPHYLAXIS (LIFE-THREATENING):
   - This is medical emergency - act immediately
   - Epinephrine is required (if available, use immediately)
   - Position person: Lying down with legs elevated (unless breathing difficulty)
   - If breathing difficulty: Keep sitting up
   - Monitor breathing closely
   - Be prepared to perform rescue breathing (see airway_obstruction.md)
   - Treat shock (see shock.md)

4. IF MODERATE REACTION:
   - Keep person calm and still
   - Monitor breathing closely
   - Watch for worsening
   - Keep person in comfortable position
   - If breathing worsens: Treat as anaphylaxis

5. IF MILD REACTION:
   - Remove allergen
   - Monitor for worsening
   - Antihistamine may help if available (see common_medicines.md)
   - Cool compresses may help with itching
   - Watch for signs of worsening

6. MONITOR CONTINUOUSLY:
   - Reactions can worsen rapidly
   - Watch breathing closely
   - Check pulse and consciousness
   - Watch for signs of shock
   - Be prepared to escalate treatment
   - CRITICAL: Biphasic reactions can occur - symptoms may return 4-8 hours after initial reaction
   - Continue monitoring for at least 8-12 hours after initial reaction
   - If symptoms return: Treat as new anaphylaxis episode

WHAT NOT TO DO:
- DO NOT induce vomiting (can worsen airway problems)
- DO NOT give food or drink if throat swelling (choking risk)
- DO NOT delay if anaphylaxis suspected
- DO NOT ignore mild symptoms (can worsen)
- DO NOT give antihistamine to unconscious person (choking risk)
- DO NOT use tourniquet for allergic reaction (not effective, different from bleeding)

IMPROVISED / LOW-RESOURCE OPTIONS:

NO EPINEPHRINE:
- Epinephrine is required for anaphylaxis but may not be available
- Focus on maintaining airway and breathing
- Position person appropriately
- Monitor closely
- Be prepared for rescue breathing
- Treat shock if develops
- Reality: Without epinephrine, anaphylaxis may be fatal

NO ANTIHISTAMINES:
- Focus on removing allergen
- Monitor closely
- Keep person calm
- Cool compresses for itching
- Watch for worsening

POSITIONING:
- If breathing difficulty: Keep sitting up or semi-sitting
- If shock developing: Lie down with legs elevated
- If unconscious: Recovery position (on side) if no spinal injury
- Support person in comfortable position

MONITORING:
- Watch breathing continuously
- Check pulse regularly
- Monitor consciousness
- Watch for signs of worsening
- Be prepared to act quickly

WHEN YOU MUST SEEK PROFESSIONAL HELP:
- Any signs of anaphylaxis (life-threatening)
- Difficulty breathing that worsens
- Person loses consciousness
- Shock develops
- Swelling of throat that worsens
- Requires epinephrine (not available in austere settings)
- Person requires advanced airway management

REALISTIC OUTCOMES & LIMITATIONS:

WITH PROPER CARE:
- Mild reactions usually resolve without treatment
- Moderate reactions may resolve with antihistamines
- Anaphylaxis requires epinephrine - without it, outcome is poor
- Even with epinephrine, person may need additional care

WITHOUT PROFESSIONAL HELP:
- Anaphylaxis is usually fatal without epinephrine
- Some reactions may resolve on their own
- Focus on maintaining airway and breathing
- Person may die despite best efforts

LONG-TERM:
- Person should avoid allergen in future
- May need to carry epinephrine if available
- Some reactions become more severe with repeated exposure
- Education about allergen avoidance is critical
- Monitor for delayed reactions (biphasic anaphylaxis)
- Watch for signs of recurrence for 8-12 hours after initial reaction

SAFETY & ACCURACY RULES:

MEDICAL REASONING:
- Allergic reactions are immune system overreactions
- Anaphylaxis causes widespread effects: Airway swelling, shock, organ failure
- Epinephrine reverses anaphylaxis by constricting blood vessels and opening airways
- Time is critical - anaphylaxis can be fatal within minutes

CLEAN VS DIRTY VS LAST-RESORT:
- Clean: Epinephrine auto-injector, antihistamines (ideal but often unavailable)
- Dirty: Focus on airway and breathing, positioning (acceptable)
- Last-resort: Maintain airway manually, rescue breathing if needed

MYTHS CORRECTED:
- "Benadryl is enough for anaphylaxis" - FALSE: Epinephrine is required
- "Wait and see" - FALSE: Anaphylaxis requires immediate treatment
- "Allergic reactions are not serious" - FALSE: Can be fatal

COMMON ALLERGENS:
- Foods: Nuts, shellfish, eggs, milk, etc.
- Medications: Antibiotics, pain medicines, etc.
- Insect stings: Bees, wasps, etc.
- Environmental: Pollen, dust, etc.
- Latex, chemicals, etc.

PREVENTION:
- Avoid known allergens
- If severe allergy: Carry epinephrine if available
- Educate others about person's allergies
- Read labels if food allergy
- Be prepared for reactions
