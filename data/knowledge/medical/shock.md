TITLE: Shock Management

KEYWORDS: shock, hypovolemic shock, blood loss, low blood pressure, pale skin, rapid pulse, circulatory collapse

SEVERITY LEVELS:
- Mild: Slightly pale, slightly rapid pulse, alert
- Serious: Pale/cold skin, rapid weak pulse, confused or anxious
- Life-threatening: Very pale/gray, very rapid weak pulse, unconscious, no urine output

WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE:
- Person has significant blood loss (see bleeding.md)
- Person has severe burns
- Person has severe dehydration
- Person has severe infection
- Person has heart problems or allergic reaction
- Signs: Pale/cold/clammy skin, rapid weak pulse, rapid breathing, confusion, loss of consciousness

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Shock is the body's response to inadequate blood flow
- Without treatment, shock leads to organ failure and death
- Time is critical: Treat underlying cause immediately
- Multiple types: Hypovolemic (blood/fluid loss), cardiogenic (heart failure), septic (infection), anaphylactic (allergy)

STEP-BY-STEP ACTIONS (DO THIS IN ORDER):

1. IDENTIFY AND TREAT UNDERLYING CAUSE:
   - Bleeding: Control bleeding immediately (see bleeding.md)
   - Burns: Cool burns, prevent further fluid loss (see burns.md)
   - Dehydration: Begin rehydration (see dehydration.md)
   - Infection: Treat infection source if possible
   - Heart problem: Keep person calm, minimize exertion
   - Allergy: See allergic_reactions.md

2. POSITION THE PERSON:
   - Lay person flat on back
   - Elevate legs 12 inches (30cm) - increases blood return to heart
   - EXCEPTION: Do NOT elevate legs if:
     * Head, neck, or spine injury suspected
     * Person has difficulty breathing (keep sitting up)
     * Person has heart failure (keep head elevated)
   - Keep person still and calm

3. MAINTAIN BODY TEMPERATURE:
   - Cover person with blankets, clothing, or whatever available
   - Keep warm but not overheated
   - Cover unburned areas if burns present
   - Prevent heat loss (critical in shock)

4. MONITOR VITAL SIGNS:
   - Check pulse: Should be strong and regular (60-100 normal)
   - Rapid weak pulse indicates worsening shock
   - Check breathing: Should be normal (12-20 per minute)
   - Rapid shallow breathing indicates severe shock
   - Check skin: Should be warm and normal color
   - Pale, cold, clammy skin indicates shock
   - Check consciousness: Alert is good, confused/unconscious is bad
   - CAPILLARY REFILL TEST:
     * Press on nail bed or skin (forehead, chest)
     * Release and count seconds until color returns
     * Normal: Less than 2 seconds
     * Shock: More than 2 seconds (indicates poor circulation)
   - URINE OUTPUT:
     * Normal: Person urinates every 2-4 hours
     * Shock: No urination or very dark urine
     * Monitor urine output as indicator of shock severity
     * No urine for 4+ hours indicates serious problem

5. FLUID MANAGEMENT:
   - If person is conscious and can swallow: Give small sips of water
   - If severe bleeding controlled: May give fluids
   - If person may need surgery: Do NOT give fluids (aspiration risk)
   - If unconscious: Do NOT give fluids (choking risk)
   - Oral rehydration solution is best if available
   - Small amounts frequently, not large amounts at once
   - FLUID LIMITS (IMPORTANT):
     * Do NOT give more than person can comfortably drink
     * Do NOT force fluids
     * If vomiting: Wait, then try again with smaller amounts
     * Monitor for signs of fluid overload (rare with oral, but watch for worsening breathing)
     * In severe shock: Oral fluids may not be sufficient (IV needed but unavailable)

6. CONTINUE TREATING UNDERLYING CAUSE:
   - Shock will not improve until cause is addressed
   - Continue bleeding control
   - Continue burn care
   - Continue rehydration
   - Monitor for improvement or worsening

WHAT NOT TO DO:
- DO NOT elevate legs if head/neck/spine injury
- DO NOT give fluids to unconscious person (choking risk)
- DO NOT give fluids if person may need surgery
- DO NOT give alcohol (worsens shock)
- DO NOT allow person to eat (if surgery may be needed)
- DO NOT move person unnecessarily (if trauma suspected)
- DO NOT use heating pads or direct heat (can cause burns, worsens shock)
- DO NOT leave person alone

IMPROVISED / LOW-RESOURCE OPTIONS:

NO BLANKETS:
- Use clothing, jackets, whatever available
- Layer materials for insulation
- Cover person completely except face
- Use body heat from others if safe

NO ELEVATION POSSIBLE:
- Keep person flat
- Focus on treating underlying cause
- Maintain warmth
- Monitor closely

FLUID REPLACEMENT:
- Water is acceptable if nothing else available
- Oral rehydration solution is better (see dehydration.md for recipe)
- Broth or soup provides some electrolytes
- Small sips frequently

MONITORING WITHOUT EQUIPMENT:
- Feel pulse at wrist or neck
- Count breaths by watching chest
- Check skin temperature and color by touch
- Monitor level of consciousness by talking to person

WHEN YOU MUST SEEK PROFESSIONAL HELP:
- Person loses consciousness
- Shock does not improve after treating underlying cause
- Person requires IV fluids (not available in austere settings)
- Signs of organ failure (no urine output, difficulty breathing)
- Multiple causes of shock (bleeding + infection, etc.)
- Person requires blood transfusion (not available)

REALISTIC OUTCOMES & LIMITATIONS:

WITH PROPER CARE:
- Mild shock often resolves when underlying cause is treated
- Moderate shock may improve with positioning and warmth
- Severe shock requires IV fluids and possibly blood transfusion
- Success depends on treating underlying cause

WITHOUT PROFESSIONAL HELP:
- IV fluids not available - oral rehydration is less effective
- Blood transfusion not available - severe blood loss may be fatal
- Some causes of shock cannot be treated without medical intervention
- Person may die despite best efforts

LONG-TERM:
- Recovery depends on underlying cause
- May take hours to days to fully recover
- Monitor for complications
- Ensure adequate nutrition and hydration during recovery

SAFETY & ACCURACY RULES:

MEDICAL REASONING:
- Shock is inadequate blood flow to organs
- Elevating legs increases venous return to heart
- Keeping warm prevents further heat loss and vasoconstriction
- Treating underlying cause is essential - shock is a symptom, not the disease

CLEAN VS DIRTY VS LAST-RESORT:
- Clean: Sterile IV fluids and monitoring equipment (ideal but unavailable)
- Dirty: Oral fluids, improvised blankets (acceptable and often only option)
- Last-resort: Focus on comfort and treating what can be treated

MYTHS CORRECTED:
- "Shock means emotional shock" - FALSE: Medical shock is circulatory failure
- "Give coffee for shock" - FALSE: Caffeine can worsen some types of shock
- "Rub the person to warm them" - FALSE: Can cause injury, does not help

TYPES OF SHOCK:

HYPOVOLEMIC (MOST COMMON IN TRAUMA):
- Caused by blood or fluid loss
- Treat by stopping bleeding and replacing fluids
- Most responsive to treatment if caught early

CARDIOGENIC:
- Caused by heart failure
- Keep person calm, minimize exertion
- May not be treatable without medical intervention

SEPTIC:
- Caused by severe infection
- Treat underlying infection
- Requires antibiotics ideally (may not be available)

ANAPHYLACTIC:
- Caused by severe allergic reaction
- See allergic_reactions.md
- Requires epinephrine ideally (may not be available)

NEUROGENIC:
- Caused by spinal injury
- Immobilize spine, treat as spinal injury
- May not be fully treatable
