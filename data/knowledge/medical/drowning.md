TITLE: Drowning and Water Emergencies

KEYWORDS: drowning, near-drowning, water rescue, submersion, respiratory arrest, water in lungs

SEVERITY LEVELS:
- Mild: Person rescued quickly, coughing but breathing, alert
- Serious: Person rescued, not breathing but has pulse, unconscious
- Life-threatening: Person not breathing, no pulse, requires immediate CPR

WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE:
- Person pulled from water
- Person was submerged or in water emergency
- Person is not breathing or has difficulty breathing
- Person is unconscious after water incident
- Person is coughing or has water-related breathing problems

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Drowning causes lack of oxygen (asphyxia)
- Brain damage begins after 4 minutes without oxygen
- Water in lungs can cause secondary drowning (hours later)
- Hypothermia may also be present (see hypothermia.md)
- Time is critical: Begin rescue breathing immediately

STEP-BY-STEP ACTIONS (DO THIS IN ORDER):

1. REMOVE FROM WATER SAFELY:
   - Do not become second victim
   - Reach, throw, row, go (in that order)
   - Use flotation device if available
   - Support person's head and neck if possible
   - Get person to dry land or stable surface

2. ASSESS CONSCIOUSNESS AND BREATHING:
   - Check if person responds
   - Check for breathing (look, listen, feel)
   - Check for pulse if trained
   - If not breathing: Begin immediately (do not waste time removing water)

3. BEGIN RESCUE BREATHING (IF NOT BREATHING):
   - Open airway: Head-tilt chin-lift (unless neck injury suspected)
   - If neck injury: Use jaw-thrust only
   - Give 2 rescue breaths
   - Watch for chest to rise
   - If chest does not rise: Reposition and try again
   - Do not waste time trying to remove water from lungs

4. BEGIN CHEST COMPRESSIONS (IF NO PULSE):
   - Position: Center of chest
   - Depth: 2-2.4 inches (5-6cm) for adults
   - Rate: 100-120 per minute
   - Ratio: 30 compressions to 2 breaths
   - Continue until person responds or help arrives
   - See airway_obstruction.md for complete CPR

5. IF PERSON IS BREATHING:
   - Place in recovery position (on side)
   - Keep head lower than body to help drain water
   - Monitor breathing closely
   - Watch for signs of secondary drowning

6. PREVENT HYPOTHERMIA:
   - Remove wet clothing
   - Dry person and cover with blankets
   - Keep warm
   - See hypothermia.md if hypothermia present

7. MONITOR FOR SECONDARY DROWNING:
   - Can occur hours after incident (usually 1-24 hours)
   - Watch for: Difficulty breathing, persistent cough, fatigue, chest pain
   - If develops: Treat as respiratory emergency
   - This is serious - monitor closely
   - SECONDARY DROWNING TIMELINE:
     * Most common: 1-4 hours after incident
     * Can occur up to 24 hours later
     * Monitor for at least 24 hours after rescue
     * Watch for any breathing problems
     * Even if person seems fine initially, continue monitoring
   - COLD WATER SUBMERSION:
     * Cold water can protect brain (slows metabolism)
     * People can survive longer submersion in cold water
     * Continue CPR longer in cold water cases
     * Do not give up too early
     * Rewarm slowly if hypothermia present (see hypothermia.md)

WHAT NOT TO DO:
- DO NOT waste time trying to remove water from lungs
- DO NOT use Heimlich maneuver for drowning (not effective, delays CPR)
- DO NOT give up too early (people can recover after prolonged submersion in cold water)
- DO NOT ignore person who seems fine (secondary drowning risk)
- DO NOT move person unnecessarily if spinal injury suspected
- DO NOT delay CPR to remove clothing or dry person

IMPROVISED / LOW-RESOURCE OPTIONS:

NO TRAINING:
- Chest compressions alone are better than nothing
- Push hard and fast in center of chest
- Continue until help arrives or person responds

MOUTH-TO-MOUTH CONCERNS:
- If unable/unwilling: Compression-only CPR is acceptable
- Focus on high-quality compressions
- Some oxygen may remain in blood

POSITIONING:
- Use firm surface
- Recovery position if breathing
- Flat for CPR if not breathing

WHEN YOU MUST SEEK PROFESSIONAL HELP:
- Person does not respond after CPR
- Person has difficulty breathing after rescue
- Signs of secondary drowning
- Hypothermia present
- Person requires advanced life support (not available)

REALISTIC OUTCOMES & LIMITATIONS:

WITH PROPER CARE:
- People can recover even after prolonged submersion in cold water
- Immediate CPR improves outcomes significantly
- Some will recover fully
- Some may have brain damage from oxygen deprivation

WITHOUT PROFESSIONAL HELP:
- Advanced life support not available
- Some may not recover despite best efforts
- Secondary drowning can be fatal
- Focus on immediate care and monitoring

LONG-TERM:
- Monitor for complications
- Some may have persistent breathing problems
- Brain damage may be permanent
- Recovery varies greatly

SAFETY & ACCURACY RULES:

MEDICAL REASONING:
- Drowning is asphyxia from submersion
- Immediate oxygen is critical
- Water in lungs can cause problems later
- Cold water can protect brain (slows metabolism)

CLEAN VS DIRTY VS LAST-RESORT:
- Clean: Proper rescue equipment, trained rescuers (ideal)
- Dirty: Immediate CPR, whatever available (acceptable)
- Last-resort: Do something, do not delay

MYTHS CORRECTED:
- "Remove water from lungs first" - FALSE: Begin CPR immediately
- "Heimlich for drowning" - FALSE: Not effective, delays CPR
- "Person is dead after X minutes" - FALSE: Cold water can protect, continue CPR

PREVENTION:
- Learn to swim
- Use life jackets
- Supervise children
- Avoid alcohol near water
- Know water conditions
- Do not swim alone
