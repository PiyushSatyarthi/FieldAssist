TITLE: Heat Exhaustion and Heat Stroke

KEYWORDS: heat stroke, heat exhaustion, hyperthermia, heat illness, high body temperature, heat exposure

SEVERITY LEVELS:
- Mild: Heat exhaustion - heavy sweating, weakness, nausea, normal or slightly elevated temperature
- Serious: Heat exhaustion worsening - confusion, rapid pulse, still sweating
- Life-threatening: Heat stroke - no sweating, very high temperature (104°F/40°C+), confusion, loss of consciousness

WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE:
- Person exposed to high heat
- Heavy sweating or sudden stop of sweating
- Dizziness, confusion, or weakness in heat
- High body temperature
- Person working or exercising in heat
- Signs of heat illness

IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES:
1. Preserve life - Heat stroke can be fatal within minutes
2. Cool immediately - Time is critical
3. Prevent worsening - Act at first signs
4. Monitor closely - Can deteriorate rapidly

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Heat stroke can cause brain damage and death
- Very high body temperature (above 104°F/40°C) is life-threatening
- Can kill within minutes if not treated
- Time is critical - cool immediately
- No sweating in heat stroke is dangerous sign

STEP-BY-STEP TREATMENT:

1. MOVE TO COOL PLACE:
   - Get person out of heat immediately
   - Move to shade or cool, ventilated area
   - Remove from direct sun
   - Do NOT delay

2. REMOVE EXCESS CLOTHING:
   - Remove tight or heavy clothing
   - Loosen all clothing
   - Allow air circulation
   - Do this while moving to cool place

3. COOL THE PERSON:
   - Use cool (not cold) water
   - Wet cloths on forehead, neck, armpits, groin
   - Pour cool water over person
   - Fan the person if possible
   - Do NOT use ice or very cold water (causes shivering, raises temperature)

4. IF HEAT STROKE (NO SWEATING, VERY HOT):
   - This is life-threatening emergency
   - Cool aggressively but safely
   - Monitor temperature if possible
   - Watch for signs of improvement
   - Continue cooling until temperature drops

5. IF CONSCIOUS:
   - Give small sips of cool water
   - Do NOT give large amounts at once
   - Do NOT give if person may lose consciousness
   - Do NOT give alcohol or caffeine

6. MONITOR CLOSELY:
   - Watch for worsening
   - Check breathing and pulse
   - Watch for signs of improvement
   - Do NOT leave person alone

FOR SPECIFIC WOUND TYPES / SPECIAL CASES:

HEAT EXHAUSTION (MILD):
- Heavy sweating
- Weakness, dizziness
- Nausea, headache
- Normal or slightly elevated temperature
- Person still sweating (good sign)
- Cool person, give fluids, rest

HEAT STROKE (LIFE-THREATENING):
- No sweating (dangerous sign)
- Very high temperature (104°F/40°C+)
- Confusion or loss of consciousness
- Rapid, strong pulse
- Hot, dry skin
- Cool aggressively, monitor closely

HEAT EXHAUSTION WORSENING:
- Sweating may stop
- Confusion developing
- Rapid pulse
- Still some sweating (not yet heat stroke)
- Cool immediately, prevent progression

HEAT ILLNESS IN CHILDREN:
- Children are more vulnerable
- Deteriorate faster
- Monitor closely
- Cool immediately
- See child_emergency_care.md for pediatric specifics

HEAT ILLNESS IN ELDERLY:
- Elderly are more vulnerable
- May not recognize symptoms
- Monitor closely
- Cool immediately

VITAL SIGNS TO CHECK:

SWEATING:
- Heat exhaustion: Heavy sweating (good - body trying to cool)
- Heat stroke: No sweating (dangerous - body cannot cool)

TEMPERATURE:
- Normal: 98.6°F (37°C)
- Heat exhaustion: Normal to 102°F (38.9°C)
- Heat stroke: 104°F (40°C) or higher (life-threatening)
- Without thermometer: Feel skin - very hot and dry indicates heat stroke

CONSCIOUSNESS:
- Heat exhaustion: Alert but weak
- Heat stroke: Confused, irritable, or unconscious

PULSE:
- Heat exhaustion: Rapid, weak
- Heat stroke: Rapid, strong

BREATHING:
- Heat exhaustion: Rapid
- Heat stroke: Rapid, may be irregular

SKIN:
- Heat exhaustion: Cool, moist, pale
- Heat stroke: Hot, dry, red

WHEN PROFESSIONAL HELP IS UNAVAILABLE:

WHAT YOU CAN DO:
- Cool person immediately
- Monitor closely
- Some will recover with cooling
- Some may need advanced care that is not available
- Focus on cooling and monitoring

REALITY CHECK:
- Heat stroke can be fatal without rapid cooling
- Some people will die despite best efforts
- Cooling is critical - do not delay
- Accept limitations - advanced care not available

LONG-TERM CARE:

AFTER COOLING:
- Keep person in cool place
- Monitor for complications
- May take hours to fully recover
- Ensure adequate hydration
- Rest is essential

MONITORING:
- Check for return of normal function
- Watch for signs of complications
- Ensure person stays cool
- Monitor hydration

PREVENTION:

AVOID HEAT EXPOSURE:
- Stay in shade during hottest hours
- Avoid strenuous activity in heat
- Take breaks in cool place
- Drink water regularly

CLOTHING:
- Wear light, breathable clothing
- Light colors reflect heat
- Loose clothing allows air circulation
- Protect head from sun

HYDRATION:
- Drink water regularly
- Do not wait for thirst
- Increase intake in heat
- Avoid alcohol and caffeine

RECOGNIZE EARLY SIGNS:
- Heavy sweating is first sign
- Weakness and dizziness
- Act before heat stroke develops
- Do not ignore symptoms

REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS:

WITH PROPER CARE:
- Heat exhaustion usually resolves with cooling and rest
- Heat stroke requires rapid cooling
- Proper cooling prevents most complications
- Most people recover fully if treated early

WITHOUT PROFESSIONAL HELP:
- Heat stroke can be fatal without rapid cooling
- Some people will die despite best efforts
- Cooling is critical - do not delay
- Accept limitations

COOLING TIME:
- Heat exhaustion: Minutes to hours
- Heat stroke: Requires rapid cooling (minutes matter)
- May take hours to fully recover

DO NOT:
- DO NOT use ice or very cold water (causes shivering, raises temperature)
- DO NOT give alcohol (increases heat loss but also dehydration)
- DO NOT give caffeine (increases dehydration)
- DO NOT give fluids if unconscious (choking risk)
- DO NOT ignore early signs (act immediately)
- DO NOT leave person in heat
- DO NOT bundle person up (traps heat)
- DO NOT delay cooling
