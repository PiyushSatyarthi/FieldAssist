WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE:
- Deciding whether to move or stay
- Evaluating movement risks
- When movement may be dangerous
- When conditions prevent safe movement
- When staying may be safer than moving
- When you are lost or disoriented
- When you are injured or exhausted
- When resources are critically low
- When professional rescue may be coming

IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES:
1. Assess movement necessity: Is movement required?
2. Assess movement risks: What are risks of moving?
3. Assess staying risks: What are risks of staying?
4. Compare options: Which is safer?
5. Assess your condition: Can you move safely?
6. Assess conditions: Are conditions safe for movement?
7. Assess resources: Do you have resources for movement?
8. Make decision: Move or stay based on assessment

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Moving when should stay: Movement can worsen situation
- Staying when should move: Staying can worsen situation
- Moving when injured: Movement can worsen injuries
- Moving when exhausted: Movement can cause collapse
- Moving in dangerous conditions: Conditions can cause injury or death
- Moving when lost: Movement can make situation worse
- Moving without resources: Movement without resources causes exhaustion
- Moving when rescue coming: Movement can miss rescue
- Wasting resources: Unnecessary movement wastes resources
- Wasting time: Unnecessary movement wastes time

STEP-BY-STEP ACTIONS:

1. ASSESS MOVEMENT NECESSITY (DO FIRST):
   - Is movement required? Can you stay where you are?
   - What is reason for movement? Is reason valid?
   - What happens if you do not move? Can you survive staying?
   - What happens if you do move? Will movement improve situation?
   - Is movement urgent? Does it need to happen now?
   - Can movement wait? Is there time to wait for better conditions?
   - Do not move unless necessary: Unnecessary movement is risky
   - Do not move if staying is safer: Safety is priority

2. ASSESS MOVEMENT RISKS:
   - Physical risks: Injury, exhaustion, collapse
   - Environmental risks: Weather, terrain, exposure
   - Navigation risks: Getting lost, wrong direction
   - Resource risks: Depleting resources, running out
   - Threat risks: Human, animal, other threats
   - Time risks: Wasting time, missing rescue
   - Do not ignore any risks: All risks matter
   - Do not underestimate risks: Risks can be severe

3. ASSESS STAYING RISKS:
   - Environmental risks: Exposure, weather, terrain
   - Resource risks: Running out of resources
   - Threat risks: Human, animal, other threats
   - Time risks: Missing opportunities, rescue timing
   - Health risks: Deteriorating condition
   - Do not ignore staying risks: Staying has risks too
   - Do not assume staying is safe: Staying may not be safe

4. COMPARE OPTIONS:
   - Which is safer? Moving or staying?
   - Which conserves resources? Moving or staying?
   - Which improves situation? Moving or staying?
   - Which has lower risk? Moving or staying?
   - Consider all factors: All factors matter

   - Do not ignore comparison: Comparison prevents mistakes

5. ASSESS YOUR CONDITION:
   - Physical condition: Can you move safely?
   - Mental condition: Can you make decisions?
   - Injury status: Are you injured? Will movement worsen injury?
   - Exhaustion status: Are you exhausted? Will movement cause collapse?
   - Resource status: Do you have resources for movement?
   - If condition prevents safe movement: Do not move
   - If condition is too poor: Do not move, rest first

6. ASSESS CONDITIONS:
   - Weather: Is weather safe for movement?
   - Terrain: Is terrain safe for movement?
   - Visibility: Can you see to move safely?
   - Threats: Are threats present that make movement dangerous?
   - Time: Is it safe time to move? (Day/night considerations)

7. ASSESS RESOURCES:
   - Water: Do you have water for movement?
   - Food: Do you have food for movement?
   - Energy: Do you have energy for movement?
   - Equipment: Do you have equipment for movement?
   - If resources insufficient: Do not move without resources
   - If resources critically low: Do not move, conserve resources

8. MAKE DECISION:
   - Based on assessment: Use assessment to decide
   - Prioritize safety: Safety is most important
   - Consider all factors: All factors matter
   - Choose safer option: Choose option with lower risk
   - Do not move if staying is safer: Safety is priority
   - Do not stay if moving is safer: Safety is priority
   - Do not ignore assessment: Assessment prevents mistakes

- If movement is more dangerous: Do not move

WHEN RESOURCES LOW:
- Assess resources: How low are resources?
- Will movement deplete resources? If yes, consider staying
- Can you conserve resources by staying? If yes, consider staying
- If resources insufficient for movement: Do not move
