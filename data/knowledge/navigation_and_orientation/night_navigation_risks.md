WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE:
- Navigating during night hours
- Traveling in darkness
- When night movement is required
- When visibility is severely limited
- When you must move at night
- When avoiding night travel is not possible
- When assessing night navigation risks
- When planning night movement

IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES:
1. Assess necessity: Is night navigation required?
2. Assess visibility: How much can you see?
3. Assess hazards: What hazards exist in darkness?
4. Assess your capability: Can you navigate safely at night?
5. Plan route: Identify safest possible route
6. Prepare light sources: If available and safe to use
7. Prepare navigation aids: Compass, map, landmarks
8. Plan for delays: Everything takes longer at night

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Reduced visibility: Cannot see hazards, obstacles, or route
- Falls and injuries: Tripping, falling from height, striking objects
- Getting lost: Navigation is extremely difficult without light
- Threat detection: Cannot see threats until very close
- Environmental exposure: Temperature drops, weather changes
- Fatigue: Night navigation is more exhausting
- Disorientation: Loss of sense of direction and location
- Panic: Darkness increases fear and stress
- Tool accidents: Using tools in low light increases injury risk
- Structural hazards: Cannot see unstable structures or obstacles

STEP-BY-STEP ACTIONS:

1. ASSESS NECESSITY (DO FIRST):
   - Is night navigation required? Can it wait until daylight?
   - What is the reason? Emergency, threat, or other?
   - What are risks of waiting vs proceeding at night?
   - Is navigation safer at night? (Concealment, temperature)
   - Can navigation be done partially? Some parts in daylight?
   - Do you have adequate light sources? Can you navigate safely?
   - Is your physical condition adequate? Rested enough for night navigation?
   - Is your mental condition adequate? Clear thinking, not exhausted?
   - Do not proceed at night unless necessary or night provides advantage

2. ASSESS VISIBILITY:
   - How much can you see? Estimate visible distance
   - What light sources are available? Moon, stars, artificial light
   - Can you see obstacles? Can you see route?
   - Can you see hazards? Can you identify dangers?
   - Is visibility adequate for safe navigation?
   - If visibility is inadequate: Do not proceed, wait for better conditions
   - If visibility is marginal: Proceed with extreme caution
   - Do not navigate in complete darkness: Too dangerous

3. IDENTIFY NIGHT-SPECIFIC HAZARDS:
   - Obstacles: Cannot see obstacles until very close
   - Terrain: Uneven ground, holes, cliffs cannot be seen
   - Water: Cannot see water depth or current
   - Structures: Cannot see unstable structures
   - Animals: Cannot see dangerous animals
   - Other people: Cannot see threats until close
   - Weather: Cannot see weather changes approaching
   - Route: Cannot see if route is blocked
   - Do not ignore hazards: Hazards are more dangerous at night

4. PLAN ROUTE CAREFULLY:
   - Use known routes: Familiar routes are safer
   - Avoid hazards: Identify and avoid known hazards
   - Plan for visibility: Route should be navigable with available light
   - Plan waypoints: Identify landmarks visible at night
   - Plan rest points: Places to rest safely
   - Plan escape routes: Alternative paths if route becomes dangerous
   - Do not plan unknown routes: Unknown routes are too dangerous at night
   - Do not plan routes with hazards: Hazards cannot be seen

5. PREPARE NAVIGATION AIDS:
   - Compass: If available, compass works at night
   - Map: If available, map helps navigation
   - Landmarks: Identify landmarks visible at night
   - Stars: If visible, stars help navigation
   - Memory: Remember route from daylight if possible
   - Do not navigate without aids: Navigation aids are essential
   - Do not rely on single aid: Multiple aids improve accuracy

6. PREPARE LIGHT SOURCES (IF SAFE):
   - Flashlight: If available and safe to use
   - Lantern: If available and safe to use
   - Fire: If safe and available
   - Moonlight: Natural light source
   - Starlight: Natural light source
   - Do not use light if it reveals position: Concealment may be more important
   - Do not depend on single light: Have backup
   - Do not waste light: Conserve batteries or fuel

7. NAVIGATE SAFELY:
   - Move very slowly: Reduced visibility requires slower movement
   - Test footing: Feel ground before committing weight
   - Use handholds: Feel before using, test stability
   - Watch for obstacles: Cannot see all obstacles
   - Use navigation aids: Compass, map, landmarks continuously
   - Check position regularly: Verify you are on route
   - Rest frequently: Night navigation is exhausting
   - Do not rush: Haste causes falls and injuries
   - Do not move blindly: Always know where you are going

8. MANAGE RISKS:
   - Accept slower pace: Everything takes longer at night
   - Accept reduced distance: Cannot travel as far at night
   - Accept higher risk: Night navigation is riskier
   - Minimize risks: Reduce risks where possible
   - Have backup plans: What if navigation fails?
   - Do not ignore risks: Risks are real and dangerous
   - Do not take unnecessary risks: Safety over speed
   - Do not proceed if risks are too high: Sometimes waiting is safer

FOR SPECIFIC CONDITIONS:

NAVIGATING WITH MOONLIGHT:
- Better visibility: Moonlight improves visibility
- Still limited: Visibility still reduced compared to daylight
- Move slowly: Still need slower movement
- Use shadows: Shadows help identify obstacles
- Do not assume full visibility: Still limited visibility
- Do not rush: Still need caution

NAVIGATING WITH STARS:
- Very limited visibility: Starlight provides minimal light
- Use for direction: Stars help determine direction
- Move very slowly: Minimal light requires very slow movement
- Use other aids: Compass, landmarks, memory
- Do not rely only on starlight: Too limited
- Do not move quickly: Too dangerous

NAVIGATING WITH ARTIFICIAL LIGHT:
- Better visibility: Artificial light improves visibility
- Reveals position: Light may reveal your position
- Limited battery/fuel: Light sources may be limited
- Use sparingly: Conserve light sources
- Do not waste light: Conserve for when needed
- Do not ignore concealment: Light may reveal position

NAVIGATING IN COMPLETE DARKNESS:
- Extremely dangerous: Complete darkness is very dangerous
- Should be avoided: Avoid if at all possible
- Move extremely slowly: Every step must be tested
- Use touch: Feel ground, obstacles, handholds
- Use sound: Listen for hazards, landmarks
- Do not proceed if avoidable: Complete darkness is too dangerous
- Do not move quickly: Extremely dangerous

VITAL SIGNS TO CHECK:

VISIBILITY:
- Distance: How far can you see?
- Clarity: How clearly can you see?
- Light: What light sources are available?
- These signs indicate if night navigation is possible

YOUR CAPABILITY:
- Physical: Can you navigate physically at night?
- Mental: Can you think clearly? Not exhausted?
- Skill: Do you have night navigation skill?
- If capability is insufficient → do not proceed

HAZARDS:
