IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES:
1. Identify destination: Where are you going?
2. Identify starting point: Where are you starting?
3. Identify route options: What routes are available?
4. Evaluate routes: Compare route options
5. Select route: Choose best route

- Failure: Poor routes may be impassable

STEP-BY-STEP ACTIONS:

1. IDENTIFY DESTINATION (DO FIRST):
   - Where are you going? Exact location, not general area
   - Why are you going? Is destination necessary?
   - What is at destination? Resources, safety, help?
   - Is destination safe? Will destination improve situation?
   - Can destination wait? Is travel urgent?
   - Do not travel without clear destination: Unclear destination causes wandering
   - Do not travel to unsafe destination: Destination must improve situation

2. IDENTIFY STARTING POINT:
   - Where are you starting? Exact current location
   - What is your current situation? Resources, condition, safety?
   - Is current location safe? Can you stay or must you leave?
   - What resources do you have? Supplies, equipment, information?
   - Do not plan without knowing start: Must know where you are
   - Do not ignore current situation: Situation affects route planning

3. IDENTIFY ROUTE OPTIONS:
   - Direct route: Shortest path to destination
   - Safe route: Safest path to destination
   - Resource route: Path with resources (water, food, shelter)
   - Known route: Familiar path to destination
   - Alternative routes: Multiple options if primary fails
   - Do not consider only one route: Multiple options provide flexibility
   - Do not ignore alternatives: Alternatives provide backup

4. EVALUATE EACH ROUTE:
   - Distance: How far is route?
   - Time: How long will route take?
   - Difficulty: How difficult is route?

   - Visibility: Can route be navigated?
   - Terrain: What terrain challenges exist?
   - Weather: How does weather affect route?
   - Threats: What threats exist on route?
   - Do not evaluate superficially: Thorough evaluation prevents problems
   - Do not ignore any factor: All factors affect route safety

5. COMPARE ROUTE OPTIONS:
   - Rank by safety: Which route is safest?
   - Rank by distance: Which route is shortest?
   - Rank by time: Which route is fastest?
   - Rank by difficulty: Which route is easiest?
   - Rank by resources: Which route has most resources?
   - Consider trade-offs: No route is perfect
   - Consider your capability: Can you complete route?
   - Consider conditions: Will conditions allow route?
   - Do not choose based on single factor: Multiple factors matter
   - Do not ignore your capability: Must be able to complete route

6. SELECT BEST ROUTE:
   - Choose based on evaluation: Use evaluation to select
   - Prioritize safety: Safety is most important
   - Consider urgency: Urgency affects route selection
   - Consider resources: Resources affect route selection
   - Consider capability: Capability affects route selection
   - Do not choose unsafe route: Safety is priority
   - Do not choose route beyond capability: Must be able to complete
   - Do not choose without evaluation: Evaluation prevents mistakes

7. PLAN ROUTE DETAILS:
   - Identify waypoints: Landmarks along route
   - Identify hazards: Dangers along route
   - Identify resources: Water, food, shelter along route

   - Estimate time: How long will route take?
   - Estimate resources: What resources are needed?
   - Plan contingencies: What if route fails?
   - Do not plan without details: Details prevent problems
   - Do not ignore hazards: Hazards must be planned for

8. PREPARE FOR ROUTE:
   - Gather supplies: Water, food, equipment needed
   - Gather information: Maps, compass, navigation aids
   - Prepare equipment: Tools, clothing, shelter materials
   - Inform others: If in group, share route plan
   - Prepare physically: Rest, hydrate, prepare body
   - Prepare mentally: Plan, prepare, focus
   - Do not start without preparation: Preparation prevents problems
   - Do not ignore preparation: Preparation is essential

9. HAVE BACKUP PLAN:
   - What if route is blocked? Alternative route?
   - What if conditions change? How to adapt?
   - What if you get lost? How to recover?
   - What if resources run out? How to resupply?
