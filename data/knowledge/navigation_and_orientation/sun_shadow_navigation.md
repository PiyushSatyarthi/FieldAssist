- Using shadows for navigation
- When compass is unavailable
- When GPS is unavailable
- When you need to determine direction
- When sun is visible
- When shadows are visible
- When other navigation methods are unavailable
- When you understand time of day

IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES:
1. Assess sun visibility: Is sun visible?
2. Assess time: What time of day is it?
3. Understand sun movement: How does sun move?
4. Use appropriate method: Which method works best?
5. Determine direction: What direction does sun indicate?
6. Verify direction: Confirm direction with other methods if possible
7. Account for season: Season affects sun position
8. Account for latitude: Latitude affects sun position

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Getting lost: Navigation errors can cause you to become lost
- Wrong direction: Incorrect navigation sends you wrong way
- Time errors: Wrong time causes navigation errors
- Seasonal errors: Not accounting for season causes errors
- Latitude errors: Not accounting for latitude causes errors
- Time waste: Navigation errors waste time and resources
- Exhaustion: Wrong routes cause unnecessary travel
- Environmental exposure: Getting lost increases exposure risk
- Sun exposure: Extended sun exposure causes heat illness

STEP-BY-STEP ACTIONS:

1. UNDERSTAND SUN MOVEMENT (DO FIRST):
   - Sun rises in east: Generally in eastern direction
   - Sun sets in west: Generally in western direction
   - Sun at noon: Sun is generally south (northern hemisphere) or north (southern hemisphere)
   - Sun moves: Sun moves across sky during day
   - Understand your hemisphere: Northern or southern hemisphere affects direction
   - Understand season: Season affects sun position
   - Understand latitude: Latitude affects sun position
   - Do not assume simple rules: Sun position varies by location and season

2. USE SHADOW STICK METHOD:
   - Find straight stick: At least 1 meter (3 feet) long
   - Find flat ground: Level ground for accurate shadow
   - Place stick vertically: Stick should be vertical
   - Mark shadow tip: Mark where shadow tip is
   - Wait 15-30 minutes: Wait for shadow to move
   - Mark new shadow tip: Mark new shadow tip position
   - Draw line: Draw line between two marks
   - First mark is west: First mark points west
   - Second mark is east: Second mark points east
   - Perpendicular line is north-south: Perpendicular to east-west line
   - Do not rush: Method requires time
   - Do not use on sloped ground: Sloped ground causes errors

3. USE WATCH METHOD (ANALOG WATCH):
   - Point hour hand at sun: Point hour hand toward sun
   - Find midpoint: Find midpoint between hour hand and 12 o'clock
   - Midpoint points south: Midpoint points south (northern hemisphere)
   - Adjust for daylight saving: Adjust if daylight saving time
   - Reverse for southern hemisphere: In southern hemisphere, midpoint points north
   - Do not use digital watch: Method requires analog watch
   - Do not use if time is wrong: Wrong time causes errors
   - Do not use if too far from equator: Method less accurate far from equator

4. USE SUN POSITION METHOD:
   - Morning: Sun is in eastern sky
   - Noon: Sun is highest, generally south (northern) or north (southern)
   - Afternoon: Sun is in western sky
   - Use time: Time helps determine direction
   - Use position: Sun position indicates direction
   - Do not use if time unknown: Time is essential
   - Do not use if sun position unclear: Unclear position causes errors

5. ACCOUNT FOR SEASON:
   - Summer: Sun is higher in sky
   - Winter: Sun is lower in sky
   - Spring/Fall: Sun is intermediate
   - Season affects sun position: Position varies by season
   - Adjust for season: Season affects accuracy
   - Do not ignore season: Season causes significant variation
   - Do not assume constant position: Position varies

6. ACCOUNT FOR LATITUDE:
   - Equator: Sun is overhead at noon
   - Higher latitude: Sun is lower, more variation
   - Latitude affects sun position: Position varies by latitude
   - Adjust for latitude: Latitude affects accuracy
   - Do not ignore latitude: Latitude causes significant variation
   - Do not assume constant position: Position varies

7. VERIFY DIRECTION:
   - Use multiple methods: Combine methods for accuracy
   - Use landmarks: Landmarks help verify direction
   - Use terrain: Terrain helps verify direction
   - Use compass if available: Compass helps verify
   - Do not rely on single method: Multiple methods improve accuracy
   - Do not ignore discrepancies: If methods disagree, reassess
   - Do not continue if uncertain: Stop and reassess if uncertain
