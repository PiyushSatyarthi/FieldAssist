WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE:
- Cooking food
- Determining if food is cooked safely
- No access to food thermometer
- Ensuring food safety through cooking
- Preventing foodborne illness

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Undercooked food can cause severe illness and death
- Insufficient cooking does not kill all pathogens
- Some foods require specific temperatures
- Time is critical: Undercooked food can be fatal

STEP-BY-STEP METHODS:

1. COOKING TEMPERATURES (IF THERMOMETER AVAILABLE):
   - POULTRY: 165°F (74°C) minimum
   - GROUND MEAT: 160°F (71°C) minimum
   - PORK: 145°F (63°C) minimum
   - BEEF STEAKS: 145°F (63°C) minimum
   - FISH: 145°F (63°C) or until opaque
   - EGGS: Until yolk and white are firm
   - LEFTOVERS: Reheat to 165°F (74°C)
   - Insert thermometer in thickest part, not touching bone

2. COOKING WITHOUT THERMOMETER:
   - POULTRY: Cook until no pink remains, juices run clear
   - GROUND MEAT: Cook until no pink remains
   - PORK: Cook until no pink (or slight pink if confident)
   - BEEF STEAKS: Can be pink inside if surface cooked
   - FISH: Cook until flesh is opaque and flakes easily
   - EGGS: Cook until yolk and white are firm
   - Better to overcook than undercook

3. THOROUGH COOKING:
   - Cook all parts thoroughly
   - Ensure center reaches temperature
   - Large pieces need longer cooking
   - Stir or turn food during cooking
   - Do not eat if uncertain

4. REHEATING:
   - Reheat to 165°F (74°C) if possible
   - Heat until steaming hot throughout
   - Do not reheat more than once
   - Discard if left out more than 2 hours

FOR SPECIFIC FOOD / WATER TYPES:

MEAT:
- Must be cooked thoroughly
- No pink in poultry or ground meat
- Juices should run clear (poultry)
- Better to overcook than undercook
- See meat_handling.md for details

EGGS:
- Cook until yolk and white are firm
- Do not eat raw eggs
- High contamination risk if raw
- Cook thoroughly

FISH:
- Cook until flesh is opaque
- Flesh should flake easily
- Do not eat raw fish (sushi risk)
- Cook thoroughly

VEGETABLES:
- Most can be eaten raw if clean
- Cooking reduces some risks
- Some vegetables must be cooked
- Cook thoroughly if uncertain

GRAINS:
- Must be cooked thoroughly
- Some grains require specific preparation
- Cook until soft and fully cooked
- Do not eat raw grains

VITAL SIGNS TO CHECK:

COOKING TEMPERATURE:
- Use thermometer if available
- Without thermometer: Visual and texture checks
- No pink in poultry or ground meat
- Juices run clear (poultry)
- Flesh is opaque (fish)
- Better to overcook than undercook

FOOD APPEARANCE:
- Should look fully cooked
- No raw appearance
- Proper texture
- Steaming hot if possible

AFTER EATING (MONITOR FOR):
- Diarrhea (within hours to days) → Medical RAG (diarrhea.md, food_poisoning.md)
- Vomiting (within hours) → Medical RAG (food_poisoning.md, dehydration.md)
- Fever (within days) → Medical RAG (fever.md)
- Stomach cramps → Medical RAG (food_poisoning.md)
- Nausea → Medical RAG (food_poisoning.md)

WHEN PROFESSIONAL HELP IS UNAVAILABLE:

WHAT YOU CAN DO:
- Cook thoroughly
- Use visual checks if no thermometer
- Better to overcook than undercook
- Monitor for illness after eating
- Adjust cooking if illness occurs

REALITY CHECK:
- Without thermometer, must rely on visual checks
- Some risk remains even with proper cooking
- Better to overcook than undercook
- Monitor for illness

LONG-TERM CARE:

MAINTAIN SAFE PRACTICES:
- Always cook thoroughly
- Use proper temperatures
- Do not skip cooking steps
- Monitor for illness
- Adjust practices as needed

IMPROVE METHODS:
- Learn proper cooking methods
- Practice temperature estimation
- Develop cooking skills
- Maintain safety standards

PREVENTION:

COOK THOROUGHLY:
- Always cook to proper temperature
- Use thermometer if available
- Use visual checks if no thermometer
- Better to overcook than undercook
- Do not eat undercooked food

MAINTAIN CLEAN COOKING:
- Clean cooking surfaces
- Use clean utensils
- Prevent cross-contamination
- Wash hands before cooking
- Keep cooking area clean

REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS:

WITH PROPER COOKING:
- Thorough cooking kills most pathogens
- Proper temperatures reduce risk
- Some risk remains
- Most illness can be prevented

WITHOUT THERMOMETER:
- Must rely on visual checks
- Some uncertainty remains
- Better to overcook
- Monitor for illness

DO NOT:
- DO NOT eat undercooked food
- DO NOT skip cooking steps
- DO NOT assume food is cooked if uncertain
- DO NOT eat raw meat, eggs, or fish
- DO NOT ignore cooking requirements
- DO NOT rush cooking
- DO NOT eat food that looks undercooked

MYTHS CORRECTED:
- "Quick sear kills all bacteria" - FALSE: Must cook to proper temperature throughout
- "If it looks cooked, it's safe" - FALSE: Must reach proper temperature
- "Pink meat is safe if it smells fine" - FALSE: Must reach proper temperature
- "Cooking makes all food safe" - FALSE: Must cook to proper temperature
