TITLE: Plant Food Safety and Foraging Risks

KEYWORDS: plant food safety, foraging, wild plants, plant identification, toxic plants, food plants, plant preparation

SEVERITY LEVELS:
- Safe: Known safe plants, properly prepared
- Risky: Unknown plants, uncertain identification
- Dangerous: Toxic plants, misidentified plants, improperly prepared

CROSS-RAG TRIGGERS:
- Vomiting after eating plants → Medical RAG (food_poisoning.md, dehydration.md)
- Diarrhea after eating plants → Medical RAG (diarrhea.md, food_poisoning.md)
- Nausea after eating plants → Medical RAG (food_poisoning.md)
- Signs of poisoning → Medical RAG (food_poisoning.md)
- Allergic reaction → Medical RAG (allergic_reactions.md)

WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE:
- Eating wild plants
- Foraging for food
- Identifying edible plants
- Preparing plant foods
- Uncertain about plant safety

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Toxic plants can cause severe illness and death
- Misidentification can be fatal
- Some plants require special preparation
- Allergic reactions can be fatal
- Time is critical: Plant poisoning can be rapid

STEP-BY-STEP METHODS:

1. POSITIVE IDENTIFICATION:
   - MUST positively identify plant before eating
   - Use multiple characteristics (leaves, stems, flowers, roots)
   - Compare to known safe plants
   - Do NOT eat if uncertain
   - Better to go hungry than eat unknown plant

2. UNIVERSAL EDIBILITY TEST (IF NO OTHER OPTION):
   - WARNING: This test is risky and should be last resort
   - Test only one part of plant at a time
   - Separate plant parts (leaf, stem, root, fruit)
   - Test small amount on skin first (wait 15 minutes)
   - If no reaction, test small amount on lips (wait 15 minutes)
   - If no reaction, test small amount in mouth (do not swallow, wait 15 minutes)
   - If no reaction, swallow small amount and wait 8 hours
   - If no symptoms, plant part may be safe
   - This test is NOT reliable - use only if no other option

3. PROPER PREPARATION:
   - Some plants require cooking
   - Some plants require soaking
   - Some plants require specific preparation
   - Follow preparation methods for known plants
   - Do not assume all plants can be eaten raw

4. START WITH SMALL AMOUNTS:
   - Even known safe plants can cause reactions
   - Test with small amount first
   - Wait and observe
   - Increase gradually if no problems

FOR SPECIFIC FOOD / WATER TYPES:

KNOWN SAFE PLANTS:
- Only eat plants you can positively identify
- Use multiple identification methods
- Follow proper preparation
- Start with small amounts
- Monitor for reactions

UNKNOWN PLANTS:
- Do NOT eat if uncertain
- Use universal edibility test only if no other option
- Test one part at a time
- Wait between tests
- Better to avoid if possible

TOXIC PLANTS (COMMON):
- Many plants are toxic
- Some look similar to safe plants
- Do not eat unless certain
- Learn to identify toxic plants in your area
- When in doubt, do not eat

PLANTS REQUIRING PREPARATION:
- Some must be cooked (removes toxins)
- Some must be soaked (removes toxins)
- Some must be prepared in specific ways
- Follow proper methods
- Do not eat raw if preparation required

VITAL SIGNS TO CHECK:

PLANT IDENTIFICATION:
- Multiple characteristics match
- Compare to known safe plants
- No characteristics of toxic plants
- Positive identification before eating

AFTER EATING PLANTS (MONITOR FOR):
- Vomiting (within minutes to hours) → Medical RAG (food_poisoning.md, dehydration.md)
- Diarrhea (within hours) → Medical RAG (diarrhea.md, food_poisoning.md)
- Nausea (within hours) → Medical RAG (food_poisoning.md)
- Stomach cramps → Medical RAG (food_poisoning.md)
- Difficulty breathing → Medical RAG (allergic_reactions.md, airway_obstruction.md)
- Swelling → Medical RAG (allergic_reactions.md)
- Confusion → Medical RAG (food_poisoning.md)
- Any unusual symptoms → Medical RAG

WHEN PROFESSIONAL HELP IS UNAVAILABLE:

WHAT YOU CAN DO:
- Only eat positively identified plants
- Use universal edibility test if no other option
- Monitor for symptoms
- Stop eating if symptoms occur
- Begin treatment if poisoning suspected → Medical RAG

REALITY CHECK:
- Plant poisoning can be fatal
- Some plants cannot be identified safely
- Universal edibility test is risky
- Better to avoid unknown plants

LONG-TERM CARE:

LEARN PLANT IDENTIFICATION:
- Learn safe plants in your area
- Learn toxic plants in your area
- Use multiple identification methods
- Practice identification
- Do not rely on memory alone

MAINTAIN SAFE PRACTICES:
- Always identify before eating
- Follow proper preparation
- Start with small amounts
- Monitor for reactions
- Do not become complacent

PREVENTION:

POSITIVE IDENTIFICATION:
- Must identify before eating
- Use multiple characteristics
- Compare to known plants
- Do not eat if uncertain
- Learn plants in your area

PROPER PREPARATION:
- Follow preparation methods
- Cook if required
- Soak if required
- Prepare properly
- Do not skip preparation steps

REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS:

WITH PROPER IDENTIFICATION:
- Known safe plants are generally safe
- Proper preparation reduces risk
- Some risk remains
- Most problems can be avoided

WITHOUT PROPER IDENTIFICATION:
- High risk of poisoning
- Misidentification can be fatal
- Universal edibility test is risky
- Better to avoid unknown plants

DO NOT:
- DO NOT eat unknown plants
- DO NOT rely on single identification method
- DO NOT skip proper preparation
- DO NOT eat large amounts of new plants
- DO NOT ignore symptoms
- DO NOT assume all plants are safe
- DO NOT eat plants that look similar to toxic plants

MYTHS CORRECTED:
- "If animals eat it, it's safe" - FALSE: Animals have different tolerance
- "All berries are safe" - FALSE: Many berries are toxic
- "Cooking makes all plants safe" - FALSE: Some toxins survive cooking
- "Universal edibility test is safe" - FALSE: It is risky, use only if no other option
