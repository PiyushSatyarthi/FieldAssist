TITLE: Food Poisoning Recognition and Response

KEYWORDS: food poisoning, foodborne illness, food contamination, food safety, illness recognition, food-related illness

SEVERITY LEVELS:
- Mild: Nausea, some vomiting/diarrhea, person alert
- Serious: Significant vomiting/diarrhea, weakness, dehydration risk
- Life-threatening: Severe dehydration, cannot keep fluids down, loss of consciousness

CROSS-RAG TRIGGERS:
- Diarrhea → Medical RAG (diarrhea.md, dehydration.md) - IMMEDIATE
- Vomiting → Medical RAG (food_poisoning.md, dehydration.md) - IMMEDIATE
- Fever → Medical RAG (fever.md)
- Severe dehydration → Medical RAG (dehydration.md, shock.md) - IMMEDIATE
- Signs of shock → Medical RAG (shock.md) - IMMEDIATE

WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE:
- Person becomes ill after eating
- Suspecting food-related illness
- Multiple people sick after eating same food
- Recognizing food poisoning symptoms
- Determining if illness is food-related

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Food poisoning can cause severe dehydration
- Dehydration can kill within days
- Some food poisoning can be fatal
- Vomiting prevents fluid intake
- Time is critical: Begin rehydration immediately

STEP-BY-STEP METHODS:

1. RECOGNIZE SYMPTOMS:
   - Nausea and vomiting
   - Diarrhea (watery or bloody)
   - Stomach cramps
   - Fever
   - Weakness and fatigue
   - Symptoms usually appear within hours to days of eating

2. IDENTIFY SOURCE IF POSSIBLE:
   - What did person eat recently?
   - Did others eat same food?
   - When did symptoms start?
   - Identify contaminated food if possible
   - Warn others who may have eaten it

3. BEGIN REHYDRATION IMMEDIATELY:
   - This is CRITICAL - dehydration is main killer
   - Start Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) immediately
   - Give small sips frequently (every 5-10 minutes)
   - Continue despite vomiting - some will be absorbed
   - See dehydration.md for complete rehydration guide → Medical RAG

4. MONITOR SEVERITY:
   - Mild: Person alert, can drink, some symptoms
   - Serious: Significant symptoms, difficulty keeping fluids down
   - Life-threatening: Severe dehydration, cannot drink, loss of consciousness
   - Adjust treatment based on severity

5. PREVENT SPREAD:
   - Isolate person's waste
   - Wash hands after contact
   - Clean contaminated surfaces
   - Prevent spread to others

FOR SPECIFIC FOOD / WATER TYPES:

FOOD POISONING FROM MEAT:
- Usually bacterial (Salmonella, E. coli, Campylobacter)
- Symptoms: Diarrhea, vomiting, fever, cramps
- Onset: 6-24 hours
- Usually resolves in 1-3 days with rehydration
- May need antibiotics (not available) → Medical RAG

FOOD POISONING FROM FISH:
- Can be bacterial or toxin-related
- Symptoms: Vomiting, diarrhea, sometimes neurological
- Onset: Can be rapid (minutes to hours)
- Some fish poisoning can be severe
- Monitor closely → Medical RAG

FOOD POISONING FROM PLANTS:
- Can be toxin-related
- Symptoms vary by plant
- Onset: Can be rapid
- Some plant poisoning can be fatal
- Monitor closely → Medical RAG

FOOD POISONING FROM WATER:
- Usually bacterial or viral
- Symptoms: Diarrhea, vomiting, fever
- Onset: Hours to days
- Usually resolves with rehydration
- See water_purification.md for prevention

VITAL SIGNS TO CHECK:

SYMPTOM SEVERITY:
- Vomiting frequency: Occasional vs frequent vs cannot keep anything down
- Diarrhea frequency: Few vs many loose stools
- Fever: Present or absent, temperature if possible
- Consciousness: Alert vs confused vs unconscious
- Ability to drink: Can drink vs cannot keep fluids down

DEHYDRATION SIGNS:
- Urine output: Less frequent, dark yellow → Medical RAG (dehydration.md)
- Thirst: Increased or loss of thirst (bad sign) → Medical RAG (dehydration.md)
- Skin: Dry, poor elasticity → Medical RAG (dehydration.md)
- Eyes: Sunken → Medical RAG (dehydration.md)
- Consciousness: Dizzy, weak, confused → Medical RAG (dehydration.md, shock.md)

SHOCK SIGNS:
- Pale, cold skin → Medical RAG (shock.md)
- Rapid, weak pulse → Medical RAG (shock.md)
- Rapid breathing → Medical RAG (shock.md)
- Loss of consciousness → Medical RAG (shock.md, airway_obstruction.md)

WHEN PROFESSIONAL HELP IS UNAVAILABLE:

WHAT YOU CAN DO:
- Begin rehydration immediately → Medical RAG (dehydration.md)
- Monitor closely
- Prevent spread
- Most cases resolve with rehydration
- Some may need antibiotics (not available)

REALITY CHECK:
- Most food poisoning resolves with rehydration
- Dehydration is main killer - prevent it
- Some cases may be more serious
- Focus on rehydration and monitoring

LONG-TERM CARE:

AFTER RECOVERY:
- Gradually return to normal diet
- Continue adequate hydration
- Monitor for complications
- May take days to fully recover

PREVENT RECURRENCE:
- Identify and avoid contaminated food
- Improve food safety practices
- Maintain proper food handling
- Learn from experience

PREVENTION:

FOOD SAFETY:
- Cook food thoroughly
- Store food properly
- Prevent cross-contamination
- Use safe water
- See other food safety guides

WATER SAFETY:
- Treat all water
- Store water properly
- Prevent contamination
- See water safety guides

REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS:

WITH PROPER CARE:
- Most food poisoning resolves in 1-3 days
- Proper rehydration prevents most deaths
- Most people recover fully
- Prevention is key

WITHOUT PROPER CARE:
- Dehydration can be fatal
- Some cases may be more serious
- Focus on rehydration
- Some may not recover

DO NOT:
- DO NOT stop fluids to "rest the stomach" (WRONG - causes dehydration) → Medical RAG
- DO NOT ignore severe symptoms
- DO NOT delay rehydration
- DO NOT assume it will pass without treatment
- DO NOT ignore dehydration signs → Medical RAG
- DO NOT ignore shock signs → Medical RAG

MYTHS CORRECTED:
- "Stop eating and drinking" - FALSE: Must continue fluids, dehydration kills
- "Food poisoning always passes quickly" - FALSE: Can last days, dehydration risk
- "Vomiting means don't drink" - FALSE: Must continue small sips, dehydration kills
