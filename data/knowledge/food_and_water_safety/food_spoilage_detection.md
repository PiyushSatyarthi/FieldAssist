TITLE: Food Spoilage Detection

KEYWORDS: food spoilage, spoiled food, food safety, food inspection, food contamination, food quality

SEVERITY LEVELS:
- Safe: Fresh, properly stored food
- Risky: Questionable food, early spoilage signs
- Dangerous: Obviously spoiled food, high contamination risk

CROSS-RAG TRIGGERS:
- Diarrhea after eating → Medical RAG (diarrhea.md, food_poisoning.md)
- Vomiting after eating → Medical RAG (food_poisoning.md, dehydration.md)
- Fever after eating → Medical RAG (fever.md)
- Stomach cramps → Medical RAG (food_poisoning.md)
- Signs of food poisoning → Medical RAG (food_poisoning.md)

WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE:
- Inspecting food before eating
- Determining if food is safe to eat
- Assessing stored food
- Deciding whether to discard food
- No access to refrigeration

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Spoiled food can cause severe illness and death
- Food poisoning can be fatal, especially in vulnerable populations
- Some spoiled food appears safe but is contaminated
- Time is critical: Discard spoiled food immediately
- Eating spoiled food can cause dehydration from vomiting/diarrhea

STEP-BY-STEP METHODS:

1. VISUAL INSPECTION:
   - Color: Unusual colors indicate spoilage
   - Mold: Visible mold (except on hard cheeses - can cut off)
   - Texture: Slimy, mushy, or unusual texture
   - Appearance: Obvious deterioration
   - WARNING: Some spoiled food looks normal

2. SMELL TEST:
   - Foul or unusual odors indicate spoilage
   - Sour, rancid, or putrid smells
   - Trust your nose - if it smells bad, it likely is bad
   - Some spoiled food has no unusual smell

3. TEXTURE TEST:
   - Slimy texture (especially meat)
   - Mushy or soft when should be firm
   - Sticky or tacky surface
   - Unusual consistency

4. WHEN IN DOUBT:
   - Discard if uncertain
   - Better to go hungry than eat spoiled food
   - Some spoiled food cannot be detected by inspection
   - Cook thoroughly if must use questionable food

FOR SPECIFIC FOOD / WATER TYPES:

MEAT (RAW):
- Color: Should be red (beef), pink (pork), or light (poultry)
- Gray, green, or brown indicates spoilage
- Texture: Should be firm, not slimy
- Smell: Should be neutral, not foul
- Slimy surface is dangerous sign
- Discard if any doubt

MEAT (COOKED):
- Should be eaten within 2 hours if not refrigerated
- Discard if left out more than 2 hours
- Reheat thoroughly if uncertain
- Discard if unusual smell or appearance

FISH:
- Should have clear eyes (not cloudy)
- Should smell like ocean, not fishy or ammonia
- Flesh should be firm, not mushy
- Discard if slimy or foul-smelling
- Very perishable - use quickly

POULTRY:
- Should be pink/white, not gray or green
- Should not be slimy
- Should not have foul odor
- Discard if any doubt
- Cook thoroughly

DAIRY PRODUCTS:
- Milk: Sour smell, curdled appearance
- Cheese: Mold (hard cheese - can cut off, soft cheese - discard)
- Yogurt: Mold, unusual texture
- Discard if uncertain

EGGS:
- Float test: Fresh eggs sink, old eggs float
- Crack test: Fresh eggs have firm whites, old eggs spread
- Smell test: Foul smell when cracked
- Discard if float or smell bad

FRUITS AND VEGETABLES:
- Mold (except hard items - can cut off)
- Soft, mushy texture
- Unusual colors
- Foul odors
- Discard if heavily spoiled

CANNED FOOD:
- Bulging cans (dangerous - botulism risk)
- Dented cans (may be safe, inspect carefully)
- Leaking cans (discard)
- Foul smell when opened
- Discard if any doubt with canned food

VITAL SIGNS TO CHECK:

VISUAL SIGNS:
- Unusual colors
- Visible mold
- Slimy appearance
- Obvious deterioration
- Bulging cans

SMELL SIGNS:
- Foul odors
- Sour smell
- Rancid smell
- Putrid smell
- Ammonia smell (fish)

TEXTURE SIGNS:
- Slimy surface
- Mushy texture
- Unusual consistency
- Sticky surface

AFTER EATING (MONITOR FOR):
- Diarrhea (within hours to days) → Medical RAG (diarrhea.md, food_poisoning.md)
- Vomiting (within hours) → Medical RAG (food_poisoning.md, dehydration.md)
- Fever (within days) → Medical RAG (fever.md)
- Stomach cramps → Medical RAG (food_poisoning.md)
- Nausea → Medical RAG (food_poisoning.md)

WHEN PROFESSIONAL HELP IS UNAVAILABLE:

WHAT YOU CAN DO:
- Inspect food carefully
- Discard if uncertain
- Cook thoroughly if must use questionable food
- Monitor for illness after eating
- When in doubt, throw it out

REALITY CHECK:
- Some spoiled food cannot be detected
- Some contamination is invisible
- Better to discard than risk illness
- Food poisoning can be fatal

LONG-TERM CARE:

ROTATE FOOD SUPPLIES:
- Use oldest food first
- Check stored food regularly
- Discard spoiled items
- Maintain fresh supplies
- Monitor storage conditions

MAINTAIN STORAGE:
- Keep food in appropriate conditions
- Protect from contamination
- Monitor temperature
- Check regularly

PREVENTION:

PROPER STORAGE:
- Store food in appropriate conditions
- Keep perishables cool
- Protect from pests
- Use proper containers
- Rotate supplies

HANDLE FOOD SAFELY:
- Wash hands before handling
- Use clean utensils
- Avoid cross-contamination
- Cook thoroughly
- Store properly after cooking

REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS:

WITH PROPER INSPECTION:
- Most spoiled food can be detected
- Visual, smell, and texture tests help
- Some spoiled food cannot be detected
- When in doubt, discard

WITHOUT REFRIGERATION:
- Food spoils quickly
- Must use food quickly
- Some foods are more perishable
- Inspection is critical

DO NOT:
- DO NOT eat food if uncertain
- DO NOT ignore obvious spoilage signs
- DO NOT eat bulging cans (botulism risk)
- DO NOT eat slimy meat
- DO NOT eat food with foul odors
- DO NOT assume food is safe if it looks normal
- DO NOT risk eating questionable food

MYTHS CORRECTED:
- "If it looks fine, it's safe" - FALSE: Some spoiled food looks normal
- "Cooking makes spoiled food safe" - FALSE: Cooking kills bacteria but not all toxins
- "Smell test is reliable" - FALSE: Some spoiled food has no unusual smell
- "Mold can be cut off" - FALSE: Only on hard items, soft items must be discarded
