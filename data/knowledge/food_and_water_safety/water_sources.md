TITLE: Water Sources - Identification and Assessment

KEYWORDS: water sources, rainwater, river water, lake water, well water, snow, ice, water collection, water assessment

SEVERITY LEVELS:
- Safe: Properly treated and tested water sources
- Risky: Untreated water from questionable sources
- Dangerous: Obviously contaminated water, standing water, water near waste

CROSS-RAG TRIGGERS:
- Diarrhea after drinking water → Medical RAG (diarrhea.md, dehydration.md)
- Vomiting after drinking water → Medical RAG (food_poisoning.md, dehydration.md)
- Fever after drinking water → Medical RAG (fever.md)
- Signs of dehydration → Medical RAG (dehydration.md)
- Water-related illness → Medical RAG (food_poisoning.md)

WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE:
- Need to find water sources in survival situation
- Assessing safety of available water
- Collecting water from natural sources
- Determining which water sources are safest
- No access to treated municipal water

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Contaminated water can cause severe illness and death
- Waterborne diseases (cholera, typhoid, dysentery) can be fatal
- Dehydration kills faster than most waterborne illness
- Some water sources appear clean but are contaminated
- Time is critical: Need water within 3 days or death occurs

STEP-BY-STEP METHODS:

1. PRIORITIZE WATER SOURCES (SAFEST TO RISKIEST):
   - Rainwater (collected properly)
   - Deep wells (protected from contamination)
   - Flowing springs (from underground)
   - Flowing rivers (fast-moving, upstream from settlements)
   - Lakes (deep, away from shore)
   - Slow-moving rivers
   - Standing water (pools, puddles)
   - Water near waste or dead animals (last resort only)

2. ASSESS VISIBLE CONTAMINATION:
   - Color: Clear is better, but clear does NOT mean safe
   - Odor: Foul smell indicates contamination
   - Floating material: Avoid if visible debris, oil, or scum
   - Dead animals nearby: High contamination risk
   - Stagnant appearance: Higher risk than flowing water
   - WARNING: Clear, odorless water can still be contaminated

3. COLLECT FROM SAFEST AVAILABLE SOURCE:
   - Choose source farthest from human waste
   - Choose source farthest from animal waste
   - Choose flowing over standing
   - Choose deep over shallow
   - Collect from middle of water body, not edges
   - Avoid collecting from surface (floating contaminants)

4. USE CLEAN COLLECTION CONTAINERS:
   - Clean containers reduce contamination
   - Do not use containers that held chemicals
   - Rinse containers with cleanest water available
   - Cover containers to prevent recontamination
   - Store collected water properly (see water_storage.md)

FOR SPECIFIC FOOD / WATER TYPES:

RAINWATER:
- Generally safest natural source
- Collect from clean surfaces (roofs, tarps)
- Avoid first flush (first 10-20 minutes washes contaminants)
- Collect in clean containers
- Still requires treatment (see water_purification.md)
- Can be contaminated by air pollution or surface contact

RIVER WATER:
- Flowing water is better than standing
- Collect from fast-moving sections
- Collect from middle, not edges
- Upstream is better than downstream
- Avoid near human settlements
- Avoid near animal crossings
- Still requires treatment (see water_purification.md)

LAKE WATER:
- Deep water is better than shallow
- Collect from middle, away from shore
- Avoid areas with visible algae blooms
- Avoid areas with dead fish or animals
- Still requires treatment (see water_purification.md)

WELL WATER:
- Deep, protected wells are relatively safe
- Check for contamination sources nearby
- Test if possible (may not be available)
- Still requires treatment if uncertain (see water_purification.md)
- Shallow wells are higher risk

SPRING WATER:
- Natural springs from underground are relatively safe
- Collect at source, not after flowing over ground
- Still requires treatment if uncertain (see water_purification.md)
- Some springs may be contaminated

SNOW AND ICE:
- Generally safe if from clean area
- Melt before drinking (cold water causes hypothermia)
- Avoid colored snow (contamination)
- Avoid snow near roads or settlements
- Still requires treatment if uncertain (see water_purification.md)
- Eating snow directly causes hypothermia

STANDING WATER (POOLS, PUDDLES):
- HIGH RISK - last resort only
- Visible contamination likely
- High bacterial load
- Requires aggressive treatment (see water_purification.md)
- Use only if no other source available

VITAL SIGNS TO CHECK:

WATER QUALITY INDICATORS:
- Appearance: Clear is better, but not guarantee of safety
- Odor: Foul smell indicates contamination
- Taste: Metallic or chemical taste indicates problems
- Source location: Distance from contamination sources
- Flow: Flowing is better than standing
- Depth: Deep is better than shallow

SIGNS OF CONTAMINATION:
- Visible particles or debris
- Unusual color (brown, green, cloudy)
- Foul odor
- Dead animals nearby
- Human or animal waste nearby
- Algae blooms
- Oil or chemical sheen

AFTER DRINKING (MONITOR FOR):
- Diarrhea (within hours to days) → Medical RAG (diarrhea.md)
- Vomiting (within hours) → Medical RAG (food_poisoning.md)
- Fever (within days) → Medical RAG (fever.md)
- Stomach cramps → Medical RAG (food_poisoning.md)
- Signs of dehydration → Medical RAG (dehydration.md)

WHEN PROFESSIONAL HELP IS UNAVAILABLE:

WHAT YOU CAN DO:
- Choose safest available source
- Treat all water (see water_purification.md)
- Monitor for illness after drinking
- Have multiple water sources if possible
- Store water properly (see water_storage.md)

REALITY CHECK:
- Some contamination cannot be removed without advanced treatment
- Some water sources may be too contaminated to use safely
- Treatment reduces but does not eliminate all risks
- Focus on prevention and proper treatment

LONG-TERM CARE:

ROTATE WATER SOURCES:
- Do not rely on single source
- Have backup sources identified
- Monitor source quality over time
- Sources can become contaminated

MAINTAIN SOURCES:
- Protect sources from contamination
- Keep collection areas clean
- Cover sources if possible
- Prevent waste from reaching sources

PREVENTION:

PROTECT WATER SOURCES:
- Keep waste away from water sources
- Bury waste at least 100 feet from water
- Do not defecate near water sources
- Do not wash near water sources
- Keep animals away from sources

IDENTIFY MULTIPLE SOURCES:
- Know location of multiple water sources
- Have backup sources identified
- Test sources if possible
- Rotate between sources

REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS:

WITH PROPER TREATMENT:
- Most water sources can be made safe
- Treatment reduces risk significantly
- Some contamination may remain
- Monitor for illness

WITHOUT TREATMENT:
- Untreated water is high risk
- Some sources are too contaminated
- Illness is likely without treatment
- Dehydration may be safer than contaminated water in short term

MYTHS CORRECTED:
- "Clear water is safe" - FALSE: Clear water can contain invisible pathogens
- "Flowing water is always safe" - FALSE: Flowing water can be contaminated
- "Spring water is always safe" - FALSE: Springs can be contaminated
- "If animals drink it, it's safe" - FALSE: Animals have different tolerance

DO NOT:
- DO NOT assume clear water is safe
- DO NOT drink untreated water if avoidable
- DO NOT collect from obviously contaminated sources
- DO NOT collect from surface of standing water
- DO NOT use containers that held chemicals
- DO NOT ignore signs of contamination
- DO NOT drink water near waste or dead animals without treatment
