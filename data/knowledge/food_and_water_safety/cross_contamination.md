TITLE: Cross-Contamination Prevention

KEYWORDS: cross-contamination, food contamination, food safety, hand washing, food handling, contamination prevention

SEVERITY LEVELS:
- Safe: Proper separation and cleaning practices
- Risky: Some contamination risk, improper practices
- Dangerous: High contamination risk, raw meat contact with ready-to-eat foods

CROSS-RAG TRIGGERS:
- Diarrhea after eating → Medical RAG (diarrhea.md, food_poisoning.md)
- Vomiting after eating → Medical RAG (food_poisoning.md, dehydration.md)
- Fever after eating → Medical RAG (fever.md)
- Signs of food poisoning → Medical RAG (food_poisoning.md)

WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE:
- Handling food
- Preparing meals
- Storing food
- Preventing foodborne illness
- No access to ideal facilities

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Cross-contamination can cause severe illness
- Raw meat bacteria can contaminate other foods
- Contamination can spread quickly
- Can cause food poisoning in multiple people
- Time is critical: Contamination happens quickly

STEP-BY-STEP METHODS:

1. HAND WASHING:
   - Wash hands before handling food
   - Wash hands after handling raw meat
   - Wash hands after using toilet
   - Wash hands after touching contaminated surfaces
   - Use soap and water if available
   - Use cleanest water available
   - Scrub for at least 20 seconds
   - Dry with clean material

2. SEPARATE RAW AND COOKED:
   - Keep raw meat separate from other foods
   - Use separate cutting boards
   - Use separate utensils
   - Do not let raw meat juices contact other foods
   - Store raw meat separately
   - Do not use same plate for raw and cooked

3. CLEAN SURFACES:
   - Clean surfaces after contact with raw meat
   - Clean cutting boards thoroughly
   - Clean utensils after use
   - Use cleanest water available
   - Sanitize if possible (bleach solution)

4. PROPER STORAGE:
   - Store raw meat separately
   - Store below ready-to-eat foods
   - Keep covered
   - Prevent juices from dripping
   - Use clean containers

FOR SPECIFIC FOOD / WATER TYPES:

RAW MEAT:
- HIGHEST RISK - handle separately
- Use separate cutting boards
- Use separate utensils
- Do not let juices contact other foods
- Clean everything after contact
- Wash hands after handling

RAW POULTRY:
- VERY HIGH RISK
- Handle with extra care
- Separate from all other foods
- Clean thoroughly after contact
- Do not let juices contact anything

RAW FISH:
- HIGH RISK
- Handle separately
- Clean after contact
- Do not let contact other foods

READY-TO-EAT FOODS:
- Keep separate from raw foods
- Do not let raw foods contact
- Use separate utensils
- Protect from contamination

VITAL SIGNS TO CHECK:

CONTAMINATION SIGNS:
- Raw meat juices on other foods
- Same cutting board for raw and other foods
- Same utensils for raw and other foods
- Unwashed hands after handling raw meat
- Contaminated surfaces

AFTER EATING (MONITOR FOR):
- Diarrhea (within hours to days) → Medical RAG (diarrhea.md, food_poisoning.md)
- Vomiting (within hours) → Medical RAG (food_poisoning.md, dehydration.md)
- Fever (within days) → Medical RAG (fever.md)
- Stomach cramps → Medical RAG (food_poisoning.md)
- Multiple people sick → Indicates contamination

WHEN PROFESSIONAL HELP IS UNAVAILABLE:

WHAT YOU CAN DO:
- Maintain separation
- Wash hands frequently
- Clean surfaces regularly
- Use separate utensils
- Monitor for illness

REALITY CHECK:
- Perfect separation may not be possible
- Do your best with available resources
- Some risk remains
- Focus on most critical practices

LONG-TERM CARE:

MAINTAIN PRACTICES:
- Always separate raw and cooked
- Always wash hands
- Always clean surfaces
- Do not become complacent
- Maintain standards

IMPROVE METHODS:
- Develop good habits
- Use available resources
- Adapt to conditions
- Maintain safety

PREVENTION:

SEPARATION:
- Keep raw meat separate
- Use separate cutting boards
- Use separate utensils
- Store separately
- Do not let contact

CLEANLINESS:
- Wash hands frequently
- Clean surfaces regularly
- Clean utensils after use
- Maintain clean area
- Use cleanest water available

REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS:

WITH PROPER PRACTICES:
- Cross-contamination can be prevented
- Proper separation reduces risk
- Some risk remains
- Most contamination can be avoided

WITHOUT IDEAL CONDITIONS:
- Perfect practices may not be possible
- Do your best
- Focus on most critical practices
- Some risk remains

DO NOT:
- DO NOT let raw meat contact other foods
- DO NOT use same cutting board for raw and other foods
- DO NOT use same utensils for raw and other foods
- DO NOT skip hand washing
- DO NOT ignore contamination
- DO NOT become complacent
- DO NOT assume surfaces are clean

MYTHS CORRECTED:
- "Quick rinse is enough" - FALSE: Must wash thoroughly
- "Same board is fine if cleaned" - FALSE: Use separate boards
- "Contamination is not serious" - FALSE: Can cause severe illness
- "Washing meat makes it safe" - FALSE: Cooking makes it safe, washing spreads bacteria
