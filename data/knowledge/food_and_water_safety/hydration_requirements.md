TITLE: Hydration Requirements and Dehydration Prevention

KEYWORDS: hydration, water requirements, daily water intake, dehydration prevention, fluid needs, water by age

SEVERITY LEVELS:
- Adequate: Meeting daily hydration needs
- At risk: Not meeting needs, early dehydration signs
- Critical: Severe dehydration, life-threatening

CROSS-RAG TRIGGERS:
- Signs of dehydration → Medical RAG (dehydration.md)
- Diarrhea → Medical RAG (diarrhea.md) - increases fluid needs
- Vomiting → Medical RAG (food_poisoning.md) - increases fluid needs
- Fever → Medical RAG (fever.md) - increases fluid needs
- Heat exposure → Medical RAG (heat_stroke.md) - increases fluid needs

WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE:
- Determining daily water needs
- Preventing dehydration
- Recognizing dehydration risk
- Adjusting water intake for conditions
- Managing limited water supplies

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Dehydration can kill within days
- Children and elderly are more vulnerable
- Dehydration worsens rapidly without intervention
- Heat and illness increase fluid needs significantly
- Time is critical: Prevent dehydration before it develops

STEP-BY-STEP METHODS:

1. UNDERSTAND DAILY REQUIREMENTS:
   - Adults: Minimum 2-3 liters (8-12 cups) per day
   - More in hot weather, with activity, or illness
   - Children: Proportionally more per body weight
   - Elderly: May need same as adults but are more vulnerable
   - Pregnant/breastfeeding: Need extra fluids

2. ADJUST FOR CONDITIONS:
   - Hot weather: Increase by 50-100%
   - Physical activity: Increase significantly
   - Fever: Increase by 20-30%
   - Diarrhea/vomiting: Increase by 50-100%
   - High altitude: Increase by 20-30%
   - Monitor and adjust as needed

3. RECOGNIZE EARLY SIGNS:
   - Thirst (early sign)
   - Dark yellow urine
   - Less frequent urination
   - Dry mouth
   - Fatigue
   - Act immediately at first signs

4. PRIORITIZE WATER USE:
   - Drinking is highest priority
   - Personal hygiene is secondary
   - Other uses are lowest priority
   - Do not ration water to dangerous levels
   - Better to find more water than to become dehydrated

FOR SPECIFIC FOOD / WATER TYPES:

ADULTS (18-65 YEARS):
- Minimum: 2-3 liters (8-12 cups) per day
- Normal conditions: 2.5-3.5 liters
- Hot weather: 3-5 liters
- With activity: 4-6 liters
- With illness: 3-5 liters

CHILDREN (VARIES BY AGE):
- Infants (0-6 months): 0.7-0.8 liters (breastmilk/formula)
- Infants (6-12 months): 0.8-1 liter
- Children (1-3 years): 1-1.3 liters
- Children (4-8 years): 1.3-1.7 liters
- Children (9-13 years): 2-2.5 liters
- Adolescents (14-18 years): 2.5-3.5 liters
- Children need proportionally more per body weight
- Children dehydrate faster than adults

ELDERLY (65+ YEARS):
- Same as adults (2-3 liters minimum)
- May not feel thirst as strongly
- More vulnerable to dehydration
- Monitor closely
- May need encouragement to drink

PREGNANT/BREASTFEEDING:
- Pregnant: 2.5-3 liters
- Breastfeeding: 3-3.5 liters
- Need extra fluids
- Monitor closely

VITAL SIGNS TO CHECK:

URINE OUTPUT:
- Normal: Every 2-4 hours, light yellow
- Early dehydration: Less frequent, dark yellow
- Moderate dehydration: No urination 4-8 hours
- Severe dehydration: No urination 8+ hours → Medical RAG (dehydration.md)

URINE COLOR:
- Light yellow: Well hydrated
- Yellow: Adequate hydration
- Dark yellow: Early dehydration
- Very dark/amber: Moderate to severe dehydration → Medical RAG (dehydration.md)

THIRST:
- Thirst is early sign of dehydration
- Do not wait for thirst to drink
- Loss of thirst in severe dehydration is bad sign → Medical RAG (dehydration.md)

SKIN ELASTICITY:
- Normal: Skin returns immediately when pinched
- Early dehydration: Slight delay
- Moderate: Slow return (1-2 seconds)
- Severe: Very slow or stays pinched → Medical RAG (dehydration.md)

MOUTH AND TONGUE:
- Normal: Moist, saliva present
- Early: Slightly dry
- Moderate: Very dry, sticky
- Severe: Extremely dry, no saliva → Medical RAG (dehydration.md)

CONSCIOUSNESS:
- Normal: Alert
- Early: Slight fatigue
- Moderate: Dizzy, weak
- Severe: Confused, irritable, unconscious → Medical RAG (dehydration.md, shock.md)

WHEN PROFESSIONAL HELP IS UNAVAILABLE:

WHAT YOU CAN DO:
- Meet daily requirements
- Increase intake in hot weather or illness
- Monitor for early signs
- Begin rehydration at first signs → Medical RAG (dehydration.md)
- Prioritize water for drinking

REALITY CHECK:
- Limited water supplies require difficult choices
- Some dehydration may be unavoidable
- Prevent severe dehydration at all costs
- Severe dehydration can be fatal

LONG-TERM CARE:

MAINTAIN ADEQUATE INTAKE:
- Drink regularly throughout day
- Do not wait for thirst
- Increase in hot weather
- Increase with activity
- Increase with illness

MONITOR REGULARLY:
- Check urine color and frequency
- Watch for early signs
- Adjust intake as needed
- Prevent dehydration before it develops

PREVENTION:

DRINK REGULARLY:
- Do not wait for thirst
- Drink small amounts frequently
- Maintain adequate intake
- Increase in hot weather
- Increase with activity

CONSERVE WATER WISELY:
- Prioritize drinking water
- Reduce non-essential uses
- Find additional sources
- Store water properly
- Do not ration to dangerous levels

REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS:

WITH ADEQUATE INTAKE:
- Dehydration can be prevented
- Regular intake maintains hydration
- Early signs can be reversed
- Most people can maintain adequate hydration

WITH LIMITED SUPPLIES:
- Some dehydration may be unavoidable
- Must prioritize drinking
- Severe dehydration must be prevented
- Difficult choices may be necessary

WATER RATIONING:
- Minimum for survival: 1 liter per day (short-term only)
- Adequate: 2-3 liters per day
- Optimal: 3-5 liters per day
- Rationing below 1 liter is dangerous

DO NOT:
- DO NOT wait for thirst to drink
- DO NOT ration water to dangerous levels
- DO NOT ignore early dehydration signs
- DO NOT use drinking water for non-essential purposes
- DO NOT assume you are getting enough water
- DO NOT ignore dark urine
- DO NOT skip water intake to save supplies

MYTHS CORRECTED:
- "Thirst is reliable indicator" - FALSE: Thirst indicates early dehydration
- "You can't drink too much water" - FALSE: Overhydration is rare but possible
- "Coffee/tea counts as water" - FALSE: Caffeine is diuretic, increases needs
- "Alcohol hydrates" - FALSE: Alcohol dehydrates
