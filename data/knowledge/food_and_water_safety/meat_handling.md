- Vomiting after eating meat → Medical RAG (food_poisoning.md, dehydration.md)
- Fever after eating meat → Medical RAG (fever.md)
- Stomach cramps → Medical RAG (food_poisoning.md)
- Signs of food poisoning → Medical RAG (food_poisoning.md)

WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE:
- Handling raw meat
- Cooking meat
- Storing meat
- Processing wild game
- No access to refrigeration

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Undercooked meat can cause severe illness and death
- Cross-contamination spreads bacteria
- Spoiled meat can be fatal
- Raw meat contains harmful bacteria
- Time is critical: Meat spoils quickly without refrigeration

STEP-BY-STEP METHODS:

1. HANDLING RAW MEAT:
   - Wash hands before and after handling
   - Use separate cutting boards and utensils
   - Keep raw meat separate from other foods
   - Do not let raw meat juices contact other foods
   - Clean surfaces immediately after contact
   - Keep meat cold if possible (use within 2 hours if not)

2. COOKING MEAT:
   - Cook thoroughly to kill bacteria
   - POULTRY: Cook to 165°F (74°C) - no pink, juices run clear
   - GROUND MEAT: Cook to 160°F (71°C) - no pink
   - PORK: Cook to 145°F (63°C) - slight pink is acceptable if temperature reached
   - BEEF STEAKS: Cook to 145°F (63°C) - can be pink inside if temperature reached
   - FISH: Cook until flesh is opaque and flakes easily
   - Without thermometer: Cook until no pink remains (poultry/ground), juices run clear
   - Better to overcook than undercook

3. STORING COOKED MEAT:
   - Eat within 2 hours if not refrigerated
   - Store in clean containers
   - Keep covered
   - Discard if left out more than 2 hours
   - Reheat thoroughly if storing

4. PROCESSING WILD GAME:
   - Field dress immediately
   - Keep clean during processing
   - Remove all internal organs carefully
   - Wash cavity if possible
   - Cook thoroughly
   - Some game may carry diseases - cook well

FOR SPECIFIC FOOD / WATER TYPES:

POULTRY (CHICKEN, TURKEY, DUCK):
- HIGH RISK - must be cooked thoroughly
- Cook to 165°F (74°C) minimum
- No pink should remain
- Juices should run clear
- Very perishable - use quickly
- High contamination risk

GROUND MEAT:
- HIGH RISK - bacteria throughout
- Cook to 160°F (71°C) minimum
- No pink should remain
- Very perishable
- Use quickly

PORK:
- Cook to 145°F (63°C) minimum
- Slight pink acceptable if temperature reached
- Can carry parasites - cook thoroughly
- Use quickly

BEEF STEAKS:
- Cook to 145°F (63°C) minimum
- Can be pink inside if temperature reached
- Surface bacteria killed by cooking
- Less risky than ground meat

FISH:
- Cook until flesh is opaque
- Flesh should flake easily
- Very perishable - use immediately
- Some fish may carry parasites
- Cook thoroughly

WILD GAME:
- Field dress immediately
- Process carefully
- Cook thoroughly (165°F/74°C minimum)
- May carry diseases
- Handle with extra care

VITAL SIGNS TO CHECK:

COOKING TEMPERATURE:
- Use thermometer if available
- Without thermometer: Cook until no pink (poultry/ground)
- Juices should run clear (poultry)
- Flesh should be opaque (fish)
- Better to overcook than undercook

MEAT QUALITY BEFORE COOKING:
- Color: Should be appropriate for type
- Texture: Should be firm, not slimy
- Smell: Should be neutral, not foul
- Discard if any doubt

AFTER EATING (MONITOR FOR):
- Diarrhea (within hours to days) → Medical RAG (diarrhea.md, food_poisoning.md)
- Vomiting (within hours) → Medical RAG (food_poisoning.md, dehydration.md)
- Fever (within days) → Medical RAG (fever.md)
- Stomach cramps → Medical RAG (food_poisoning.md)
- Nausea → Medical RAG (food_poisoning.md)

WHEN PROFESSIONAL HELP IS UNAVAILABLE:

WHAT YOU CAN DO:
- Cook meat thoroughly
- Prevent cross-contamination
- Use meat quickly
- Discard if uncertain
- Monitor for illness after eating

REALITY CHECK:
- Without refrigeration, meat spoils quickly
- Must cook thoroughly
- Some risk remains even with proper cooking
- Better to overcook than undercook

LONG-TERM CARE:

MAINTAIN SAFE PRACTICES:
- Always cook thoroughly
- Prevent cross-contamination
- Use meat quickly
- Store properly
- Discard if uncertain

MONITOR FOR ILLNESS:
- Watch for symptoms after eating
- Adjust practices if illness occurs
- Learn from experience
- Maintain safety standards

PREVENTION:

COOK THOROUGHLY:
- Always cook to proper temperature
- Use thermometer if available
- Better to overcook than undercook
- Do not eat raw or undercooked meat

PREVENT CROSS-CONTAMINATION:
- Use separate cutting boards
- Use separate utensils
- Wash hands frequently
- Clean surfaces after contact
- Keep raw meat separate

REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS:

WITH PROPER HANDLING:
- Thorough cooking kills most bacteria
- Proper handling reduces risk
- Some risk remains
- Most illness can be prevented

WITHOUT REFRIGERATION:
- Meat spoils quickly
- Must use within hours
- Must cook thoroughly
- Some risk remains

DO NOT:
- DO NOT eat raw or undercooked meat
- DO NOT let raw meat contact other foods
- DO NOT use same cutting board for raw meat and other foods
- DO NOT leave cooked meat out more than 2 hours
- DO NOT eat meat if uncertain
- DO NOT skip thorough cooking
- DO NOT ignore spoilage signs

MYTHS CORRECTED:
- "Pink meat is safe if it smells fine" - FALSE: Must reach proper temperature
- "Washing meat makes it safe" - FALSE: Cooking is what makes it safe
- "Quick sear kills all bacteria" - FALSE: Must cook to proper temperature throughout
- "Game meat is always safe" - FALSE: Can carry diseases, must cook thoroughly
