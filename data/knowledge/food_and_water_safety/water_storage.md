TITLE: Water Storage Safety

KEYWORDS: water storage, storing water, water containers, water recontamination, water rotation, water preservation

SEVERITY LEVELS:
- Safe: Properly stored water in clean containers
- Risky: Water stored in questionable containers or conditions
- Dangerous: Stored water that has become contaminated

CROSS-RAG TRIGGERS:
- Diarrhea after drinking stored water → Medical RAG (diarrhea.md, dehydration.md)
- Vomiting after drinking stored water → Medical RAG (food_poisoning.md, dehydration.md)
- Signs of contamination in stored water → Water purification methods
- Signs of dehydration → Medical RAG (dehydration.md)

WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE:
- Storing water for future use
- Maintaining stored water supplies
- Preventing recontamination of treated water
- Rotating water supplies
- Long-term water storage

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Stored water can become contaminated
- Containers can introduce contamination
- Improper storage allows bacterial growth
- Recontamination negates treatment efforts
- Time is critical: Need safe stored water for survival

STEP-BY-STEP METHODS:

1. CHOOSE APPROPRIATE CONTAINERS:
   - Food-grade plastic containers (best)
   - Glass containers (good, but breakable)
   - Metal containers (stainless steel, avoid aluminum)
   - Clean, sealable containers
   - Do NOT use containers that held chemicals, fuel, or non-food items
   - Do NOT use milk jugs (degrade quickly)
   - Containers should be clean and sanitized

2. PREPARE CONTAINERS:
   - Wash containers with soap and water
   - Rinse thoroughly
   - Sanitize with bleach solution (1 teaspoon bleach per quart of water)
   - Rinse with clean water
   - Let air dry
   - Do not use containers that cannot be cleaned

3. FILL CONTAINERS:
   - Fill with treated water (boiled or chemically treated)
   - Leave small air space at top (for expansion if freezing)
   - Seal tightly
   - Label with date
   - Store in appropriate location

4. STORE PROPERLY:
   - Store in cool, dark place
   - Avoid direct sunlight
   - Keep away from chemicals and fuels
   - Keep containers off ground
   - Protect from contamination
   - Rotate regularly (see below)

5. MAINTAIN STORED WATER:
   - Check containers regularly
   - Look for signs of contamination
   - Rotate water every 6 months (or more frequently)
   - Replace if contaminated
   - Keep containers sealed when not in use

FOR SPECIFIC FOOD / WATER TYPES:

TREATED WATER (BOILED):
- Store in clean containers
- Will remain safe if properly stored
- Rotate every 6 months
- Re-treat if uncertain

TREATED WATER (CHEMICALLY):
- Store in clean containers
- May need re-treatment if stored long-term
- Rotate every 6 months
- Check chemical smell (should be present)

RAINWATER:
- Treat before storing
- Store in clean containers
- Rotate regularly
- Monitor for contamination

WELL WATER:
- Treat if uncertain
- Store in clean containers
- Rotate regularly
- Monitor quality

VITAL SIGNS TO CHECK:

CONTAINER CONDITION:
- No cracks or leaks
- Seals properly
- No visible contamination
- Clean appearance

STORED WATER QUALITY:
- Clear appearance
- No unusual odor
- No visible particles
- No algae growth
- Slight chemical smell if chemically treated (good sign)

SIGNS OF CONTAMINATION:
- Cloudy appearance
- Unusual odor
- Visible particles or growth
- Container damage
- If contaminated: Discard and replace

AFTER DRINKING STORED WATER (MONITOR FOR):
- Diarrhea (within hours to days) → Medical RAG (diarrhea.md)
- Vomiting (within hours) → Medical RAG (food_poisoning.md)
- Fever (within days) → Medical RAG (fever.md)
- Stomach cramps → Medical RAG (food_poisoning.md)

WHEN PROFESSIONAL HELP IS UNAVAILABLE:

WHAT YOU CAN DO:
- Store water properly
- Rotate regularly
- Monitor for contamination
- Re-treat if uncertain
- Discard contaminated water

REALITY CHECK:
- Stored water can become contaminated
- Containers can degrade over time
- Regular rotation is essential
- Some contamination may not be visible

LONG-TERM CARE:

ROTATION SCHEDULE:
- Rotate stored water every 6 months
- Use oldest water first
- Replace with fresh treated water
- Mark dates clearly
- Maintain supply

CONTAINER MAINTENANCE:
- Check containers regularly
- Replace damaged containers
- Clean containers before refilling
- Sanitize containers periodically
- Keep containers sealed

PREVENTION:

PREVENT RECONTAMINATION:
- Keep containers sealed
- Do not dip into stored water
- Use clean utensils to access water
- Do not store near contaminants
- Protect from contamination sources

MAINTAIN CLEAN STORAGE AREA:
- Keep storage area clean
- Protect from pests
- Keep away from chemicals
- Maintain proper temperature
- Ensure good ventilation

REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS:

WITH PROPER STORAGE:
- Water can remain safe for months
- Proper containers prevent contamination
- Regular rotation maintains safety
- Some risk remains

WITHOUT PROPER STORAGE:
- Water can become contaminated
- Containers can degrade
- Recontamination is likely
- Water may become unsafe

STORAGE DURATION:
- Treated water: Safe for 6 months if properly stored
- May be safe longer if conditions ideal
- Rotate every 6 months to be safe
- Check quality before using

DO NOT:
- DO NOT store water in non-food-grade containers
- DO NOT use containers that held chemicals
- DO NOT store water near contaminants
- DO NOT skip rotation
- DO NOT ignore signs of contamination
- DO NOT dip into stored water (contaminates entire supply)
- DO NOT store in direct sunlight

MYTHS CORRECTED:
- "Water never goes bad" - FALSE: Can become contaminated
- "Any container is fine" - FALSE: Must be food-grade
- "Stored water doesn't need rotation" - FALSE: Regular rotation is essential
- "If it looks clear, it's safe" - FALSE: Contamination may not be visible
