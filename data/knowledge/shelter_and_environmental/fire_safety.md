TITLE: Fire Safety and Heat Management

KEYWORDS: fire safety, fire placement, carbon monoxide, burn prevention, fire extinguishing, indoor fire safety

SEVERITY LEVELS:
- Safe: Properly managed fire with adequate safety
- Risky: Fire with some safety concerns
- Dangerous: Fire in unsafe conditions, high burn/CO risk

CROSS-RAG TRIGGERS:
- Burns from fire → Medical RAG (burns.md) - IMMEDIATE
- Smoke inhalation → Medical RAG (smoke_carbon_monoxide.md, respiratory_illness.md) - IMMEDIATE
- CO poisoning → Medical RAG (smoke_carbon_monoxide.md) - IMMEDIATE
- Unconscious from smoke/CO → Medical RAG (airway_obstruction.md) - IMMEDIATE
- Fire spreads → Evacuate immediately

WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE:
- Building or using fire
- Fire for heat in shelter
- Fire for cooking
- Fire safety concerns
- Preventing fire-related injuries

IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES:
1. Preserve life - Fire can cause burns, smoke inhalation, CO poisoning
2. Ensure adequate ventilation (critical for indoor fires)
3. Prevent burns
4. Prevent fire spread
5. Monitor for smoke/CO

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Fire can cause severe burns
- Smoke inhalation can cause respiratory failure
- Carbon monoxide can kill silently (odorless)
- Fire can spread and cause larger disaster
- Time is critical: Burns and CO poisoning can be rapid

STEP-BY-STEP ACTIONS:

1. FIRE PLACEMENT:
   - OUTDOOR: Safe distance from shelter (minimum 10 feet/3 meters)
   - INDOOR: Only if adequate ventilation (see below)
   - Clear area of flammable materials
   - Have means to extinguish nearby
   - Do NOT place fire too close to shelter

2. VENTILATION (CRITICAL FOR INDOOR FIRES):
   - Indoor fires REQUIRE ventilation
   - Create opening for smoke/CO to escape
   - Create opening for fresh air to enter
   - Monitor air quality continuously
   - Do NOT use fire in unventilated enclosed space

3. PREVENT BURNS:
   - Keep fire controlled
   - Do not reach into fire
   - Use tools to tend fire
   - Keep flammable materials away
   - Do not leave fire unattended
   - Have burn treatment ready → Medical RAG (burns.md)

4. MONITOR FOR SMOKE/CO:
   - Watch for smoke buildup
   - Watch for symptoms (headache, confusion, dizziness)
   - Monitor air quality
   - Evacuate if symptoms develop
   - See smoke_carbon_monoxide.md for details

5. FIRE EXTINGUISHING:
   - Have means to extinguish ready
   - Water if available
   - Dirt/sand to smother
   - Do not leave fire burning unattended
   - Extinguish completely before leaving

FOR SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENTS / CONDITIONS:

OUTDOOR FIRE:
- Safer than indoor (better ventilation)
- Still need safe distance from shelter
- Clear area of flammable materials
- Have means to extinguish
- Monitor for spread

INDOOR FIRE:
- HIGH RISK - requires adequate ventilation
- Must have openings for smoke/CO to escape
- Must have openings for fresh air
- Monitor continuously
- Evacuate if problems develop

FIRE IN SHELTER:
- Must have ventilation
- Safe distance from walls/roof
- Monitor for smoke buildup
- Have escape route
- Do NOT seal shelter completely

COOKING FIRE:
- Same safety rules apply
- May be closer to person (monitor closely)
- Prevent burns from cooking
- Ensure adequate ventilation if indoor
- Extinguish when done

VITAL SIGNS TO CHECK:

FIRE SAFETY:
- Ventilation: Adequate or inadequate
- Smoke buildup: Present or absent
- Distance from shelter: Safe or too close
- Control: Controlled or uncontrolled
- Extinguishing means: Available or not

PERSON CONDITION:
- Burns → Medical RAG (burns.md) - IMMEDIATE
- Breathing problems → Medical RAG (smoke_carbon_monoxide.md, airway_obstruction.md) - IMMEDIATE
- Headache/confusion → Medical RAG (smoke_carbon_monoxide.md) - IMMEDIATE, remove from source
- Unconscious → Medical RAG (airway_obstruction.md) - IMMEDIATE

AFTER FIRE EXPOSURE (MONITOR FOR):
- Burns → Medical RAG (burns.md) - IMMEDIATE
- Smoke inhalation → Medical RAG (smoke_carbon_monoxide.md, respiratory_illness.md)
- CO poisoning → Medical RAG (smoke_carbon_monoxide.md) - IMMEDIATE

WHEN PROFESSIONAL HELP IS UNAVAILABLE:

WHAT YOU CAN DO:
- Ensure adequate ventilation
- Prevent burns
- Monitor for smoke/CO
- Extinguish if unsafe
- If burns occur → Medical RAG (burns.md)
- If smoke/CO exposure → Medical RAG (smoke_carbon_monoxide.md)

REALITY CHECK:
- Fire is necessary but dangerous
- Some risk remains even with proper safety
- Focus on most critical safety measures
- Ventilation is mandatory for indoor fires

LONG-TERM CARE:

MAINTAIN SAFE PRACTICES:
- Always ensure ventilation
- Always prevent burns
- Always monitor for problems
- Always have extinguishing means
- Do not become complacent

IMPROVE SAFETY:
- Learn from experience
- Improve ventilation
- Improve fire management
- Maintain safety standards
- Adapt to conditions

PREVENTION:

ADEQUATE VENTILATION:
- Indoor fires require ventilation
- Create openings for smoke/CO to escape
- Create openings for fresh air
- Monitor continuously
- Do NOT use fire in unventilated space

BURN PREVENTION:
- Keep fire controlled
- Use tools to tend fire
- Keep flammable materials away
- Do not leave unattended
- Have treatment ready → Medical RAG

REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS:

WITH PROPER SAFETY:
- Fire can be used safely
- Proper ventilation prevents CO buildup
- Most burns can be prevented
- Some risk remains

WITHOUT PROPER SAFETY:
- Burns are likely
- CO poisoning is likely
- May be fatal
- Focus on adequate safety

FIRE SAFETY REQUIREMENTS:
- Ventilation: Mandatory for indoor fires
- Distance: Safe distance from shelter
- Control: Fire must be controlled
- Monitoring: Continuous monitoring required
- Extinguishing: Means must be available

DO NOT:
- DO NOT use fire in unventilated enclosed space
- DO NOT ignore smoke buildup
- DO NOT ignore symptoms (headache, confusion) → Medical RAG
- DO NOT place fire too close to shelter
- DO NOT leave fire unattended
- DO NOT ignore ventilation requirements
- DO NOT assume fire is safe indoors

MYTHS CORRECTED:
- "Fire indoors is always safe if small" - FALSE: Even small fires produce CO, need ventilation
- "You can see/smell CO" - FALSE: CO is odorless and invisible
- "A little smoke won't hurt" - FALSE: Smoke can cause respiratory problems
- "Ventilation is optional" - FALSE: Ventilation is mandatory for indoor fires
