TITLE: Heat Illness Prevention and Shelter

KEYWORDS: heat exhaustion, heat stroke, hyperthermia, heat exposure, sun protection, heat shelter, shade

SEVERITY LEVELS:
- Mild: Heat exhaustion - heavy sweating, weakness, normal or slightly elevated temperature
- Serious: Heat exhaustion worsening - confusion, rapid pulse, still sweating
- Life-threatening: Heat stroke - no sweating, very high temperature (104°F/40°C+), confusion, loss of consciousness

CROSS-RAG TRIGGERS:
- Heat stroke → Medical RAG (heat_stroke.md) - IMMEDIATE
- Heat exhaustion → Medical RAG (heat_stroke.md)
- Dehydration from heat → Food & Water RAG (hydration_requirements.md, dehydration.md) - IMMEDIATE
- Unconscious from heat → Medical RAG (heat_stroke.md, airway_obstruction.md) - IMMEDIATE
- Fever from heat → Medical RAG (fever.md)

WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE:
- Exposure to high heat
- Need to prevent heat illness
- Building shelter in hot conditions
- Person showing signs of heat illness
- No access to cool shelter
- Hot weather survival situation

IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES:
1. Preserve life - Heat stroke can be fatal within minutes
2. Get to shade immediately
3. Cool the person
4. Prevent further heat exposure
5. Begin rehydration

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Heat stroke can cause brain damage and death
- Very high body temperature (above 104°F/40°C) is life-threatening
- Dehydration increases heat illness risk
- Time is critical: Heat stroke can kill within minutes
- No sweating in heat stroke is dangerous sign

STEP-BY-STEP ACTIONS:

1. GET TO SHADE:
   - Get out of direct sun immediately
   - Find or create shade
   - Get to coolest available location
   - Do NOT delay - every minute matters
   - If cannot move: Create shade where you are

2. REMOVE EXCESS CLOTHING:
   - Remove tight or heavy clothing
   - Allow air circulation
   - Keep person covered but not overheated
   - Do this while getting to shade

3. CREATE OR FIND SHELTER:
   - Get out of direct sun
   - Find natural shade (trees, overhangs, caves)
   - Build shade if necessary (see shelter_basics.md)
   - Create ventilation
   - Avoid enclosed spaces that trap heat

4. COOL THE PERSON:
   - Use cool (not cold) water
   - Wet cloths on forehead, neck, armpits, groin
   - Fan if possible
   - Do NOT use ice or very cold water (causes shivering, raises temperature)
   - Continue cooling

5. BEGIN REHYDRATION:
   - Heat increases fluid needs significantly
   - Begin rehydration immediately → Food & Water RAG (hydration_requirements.md)
   - Give small sips frequently
   - Do NOT give if person may lose consciousness
   - Monitor closely → Medical RAG if dehydration develops

6. PREVENT FURTHER EXPOSURE:
   - Stay in shade during hottest hours
   - Minimize activity
   - Rest is essential
   - Avoid exertion in heat
   - Monitor for worsening

FOR SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENTS / CONDITIONS:

HOT AND DRY:
- Dehydration risk is high → Food & Water RAG (hydration_requirements.md)
- Need shade and water
- Create shelter from sun
- Maintain hydration
- Monitor closely

HOT AND HUMID:
- Sweating is less effective
- Higher heat illness risk
- Need shade and ventilation
- Maintain hydration
- Monitor very closely

HOT AND SUNNY:
- Direct sun increases heat significantly
- Need shade immediately
- Protect from sun exposure
- Maintain hydration
- Monitor for heat illness

HOT AND NO WATER:
- CRITICAL SITUATION
- Find water sources → Food & Water RAG (water_sources.md)
- Conserve water wisely → Food & Water RAG (hydration_requirements.md)
- Minimize activity
- Seek shade
- Dehydration is main risk → Food & Water RAG, Medical RAG

HOT AND INJURED:
- Injury increases heat illness risk
- Keep injured person cool
- Maintain hydration
- Monitor closely
- See appropriate Medical RAG guides

VITAL SIGNS TO CHECK:

SWEATING:
- Heat exhaustion: Heavy sweating (good - body trying to cool) → Monitor, maintain cooling
- Heat stroke: No sweating (dangerous - body cannot cool) → Medical RAG (heat_stroke.md) - IMMEDIATE

TEMPERATURE:
- Normal: 98.6°F (37°C)
- Heat exhaustion: Normal to 102°F (38.9°C) → Monitor, cool person
- Heat stroke: 104°F (40°C) or higher → Medical RAG (heat_stroke.md) - IMMEDIATE
- Without thermometer: Feel skin - very hot and dry indicates heat stroke → Medical RAG

CONSCIOUSNESS:
- Heat exhaustion: Alert but weak → Monitor, cool person
- Heat stroke: Confused, irritable, or unconscious → Medical RAG (heat_stroke.md, airway_obstruction.md) - IMMEDIATE

DEHYDRATION SIGNS:
- Thirst, dark urine → Food & Water RAG (hydration_requirements.md, dehydration.md)
- No urination → Food & Water RAG, Medical RAG (dehydration.md) - IMMEDIATE
- Dry mouth → Food & Water RAG, Medical RAG

BREATHING:
- Heat exhaustion: Rapid
- Heat stroke: Rapid, may be irregular → Medical RAG (heat_stroke.md) - IMMEDIATE

WHEN PROFESSIONAL HELP IS UNAVAILABLE:

WHAT YOU CAN DO:
- Get to shade immediately
- Cool person
- Begin rehydration → Food & Water RAG
- Monitor closely
- Prevent further exposure
- If heat stroke develops → Medical RAG (heat_stroke.md)

REALITY CHECK:
- Heat stroke can be fatal without rapid cooling
- Some may not survive despite best efforts
- Dehydration must be prevented → Food & Water RAG
- Focus on prevention and immediate cooling

LONG-TERM CARE:

MAINTAIN SHELTER:
- Keep shade available
- Maintain ventilation
- Prevent heat buildup
- Monitor conditions
- Adapt as needed

MONITOR CONTINUOUSLY:
- Check for heat illness signs
- Maintain cooling
- Maintain hydration → Food & Water RAG
- Monitor throughout exposure
- Prevent recurrence

PREVENTION:

PREPARE BEFORE HEAT:
- Know how to create shade
- Have water available → Food & Water RAG
- Know location of shade/water
- Prepare for heat exposure
- Have means to cool

RECOGNIZE EARLY SIGNS:
- Heavy sweating is first sign
- Act before heat stroke develops
- Do not ignore heat exposure
- Get to shade early
- Maintain hydration → Food & Water RAG

REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS:

WITH PROPER SHELTER:
- Heat illness can be prevented
- Shade reduces heat significantly
- Most can stay cool with adequate shelter
- Hydration is critical → Food & Water RAG

WITHOUT PROPER SHELTER:
- Heat illness is likely
- May not be preventable
- Some will develop heat illness
- Focus on best available shelter

SHELTER EFFECTIVENESS:
- Good shade: Prevents most heat gain
- Adequate shade: Reduces heat significantly
- Poor shade: Some protection, but heat illness risk remains
- No shade: Heat illness likely

DO NOT:
- DO NOT stay in direct sun
- DO NOT ignore early heat illness signs → Medical RAG
- DO NOT skip hydration → Food & Water RAG
- DO NOT use ice or very cold water (causes shivering)
- DO NOT become complacent
- DO NOT ignore no sweating (heat stroke sign) → Medical RAG
- DO NOT delay getting to shade

MYTHS CORRECTED:
- "Drink when thirsty" - FALSE: Thirst indicates early dehydration, drink before → Food & Water RAG
- "Sweating means you're fine" - FALSE: Sweating is good, but monitor for heat stroke
- "Heat stroke only happens in extreme heat" - FALSE: Can occur in moderate heat with activity
- "Shade is optional" - FALSE: Shade is critical in hot conditions
