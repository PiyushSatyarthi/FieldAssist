TITLE: Wind and Rain Protection

KEYWORDS: wind protection, rain protection, wet exposure, wind chill, moisture management, shelter from elements

SEVERITY LEVELS:
- Mild: Uncomfortable but manageable exposure
- Serious: Significant heat loss, difficulty maintaining warmth
- Life-threatening: Severe hypothermia risk, cannot maintain body temperature

CROSS-RAG TRIGGERS:
- Hypothermia from wet/cold → Medical RAG (hypothermia.md) - IMMEDIATE
- Shivering stops → Medical RAG (hypothermia.md) - IMMEDIATE
- Unconscious from cold → Medical RAG (hypothermia.md, airway_obstruction.md) - IMMEDIATE
- Frostbite → Medical RAG (frostbite.md)

WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE:
- Exposure to wind
- Exposure to rain or wet conditions
- Need to stay dry
- Building shelter in wet/windy conditions
- Person is wet or exposed to wind
- No access to dry shelter

IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES:
1. Preserve life - Wind and wet can cause fatal hypothermia
2. Get out of wind immediately
3. Get dry as quickly as possible
4. Create barrier from elements
5. Prevent further exposure

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Wind increases heat loss significantly (wind chill effect)
- Wet clothing increases heat loss 25x
- Combination of wind and wet is extremely dangerous
- Hypothermia can develop rapidly
- Time is critical: Act immediately

STEP-BY-STEP ACTIONS:

1. GET OUT OF WIND:
   - Wind increases heat loss dramatically
   - Find or create wind barrier immediately
   - Get behind natural windbreaks (trees, rocks, terrain)
   - Build wind-resistant shelter if necessary
   - Do NOT delay

2. GET DRY:
   - Remove wet clothing immediately
   - Replace with dry clothing if available
   - If no dry clothing: Remove wet, wrap in whatever available
   - Do NOT stay in wet clothing
   - Prevent further wetting

3. CREATE SHELTER FROM RAIN:
   - Get under cover immediately
   - Use natural shelter if available (caves, overhangs, dense trees)
   - Build rain-resistant shelter if necessary (see shelter_basics.md)
   - Keep shelter area dry
   - Prevent water from entering

4. INSULATE FROM GROUND:
   - Wet ground conducts heat away
   - Place insulating material between body and ground
   - Keep insulation dry
   - Use multiple layers if possible
   - Do NOT lie on wet ground

5. MAINTAIN VENTILATION:
   - Need some air movement to prevent condensation
   - But minimize wind exposure
   - Balance ventilation with protection
   - Prevent moisture buildup in shelter
   - Monitor conditions

FOR SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENTS / CONDITIONS:

WINDY CONDITIONS:
- Wind increases heat loss significantly
- Get out of wind immediately
- Create wind barrier
- Use natural windbreaks
- Build wind-resistant shelter

RAINY CONDITIONS:
- Rain wets clothing and increases heat loss
- Get under cover immediately
- Stay dry
- Prevent water from entering shelter
- Remove wet clothing

WINDY AND RAINY:
- EXTREMELY DANGEROUS - highest risk
- Get out of both immediately
- Create shelter from both
- Get dry
- Prevent further exposure

WET GROUND:
- Ground conducts heat when wet
- Insulate from ground
- Keep insulation dry
- Use multiple layers
- Do NOT lie directly on wet ground

FLOODING CONDITIONS:
- Get to high ground
- Avoid floodwaters
- Create elevated shelter if possible
- Monitor water levels
- Be prepared to move

VITAL SIGNS TO CHECK:

HEAT LOSS:
- Shivering: Early sign of heat loss → Monitor, maintain warmth
- Shivering stops: Serious heat loss → Medical RAG (hypothermia.md) - IMMEDIATE
- Cold skin: Heat loss occurring → Monitor, increase protection

WET EXPOSURE:
- Clothing wet: High heat loss risk → Remove wet clothing immediately
- Skin wet: High heat loss risk → Dry immediately
- Shelter wet: Heat loss risk → Improve shelter, stay dry

WIND EXPOSURE:
- Feeling wind: Heat loss occurring → Get out of wind
- Cannot maintain warmth: Serious risk → Medical RAG (hypothermia.md)
- Shivering increases: Wind increasing heat loss → Get better protection

AFTER EXPOSURE (MONITOR FOR):
- Hypothermia signs → Medical RAG (hypothermia.md) - IMMEDIATE
- Shivering stops → Medical RAG (hypothermia.md) - IMMEDIATE
- Confusion → Medical RAG (hypothermia.md)
- Unconscious → Medical RAG (hypothermia.md, airway_obstruction.md) - IMMEDIATE

WHEN PROFESSIONAL HELP IS UNAVAILABLE:

WHAT YOU CAN DO:
- Get out of wind and rain immediately
- Get dry
- Create shelter
- Insulate from ground
- Monitor for hypothermia → Medical RAG if develops

REALITY CHECK:
- Some exposure may be unavoidable
- Focus on minimizing exposure
- Act quickly
- Some may develop hypothermia despite best efforts

LONG-TERM CARE:

MAINTAIN SHELTER:
- Keep shelter in good condition
- Maintain protection from elements
- Prevent moisture
- Monitor for problems
- Adapt as needed

MONITOR CONTINUOUSLY:
- Check for hypothermia signs
- Maintain dryness
- Maintain warmth
- Monitor throughout exposure
- Prevent further exposure

PREVENTION:

PREPARE BEFORE EXPOSURE:
- Know how to create shelter
- Have materials if possible
- Know location of shelter sites
- Prepare for wet/windy conditions
- Have dry clothing if possible

RECOGNIZE RISK:
- Wind and wet are dangerous
- Act before hypothermia develops
- Do not ignore exposure
- Get to shelter early
- Prevent hypothermia before it develops

REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS:

WITH PROPER PROTECTION:
- Wind and wet exposure can be minimized
- Proper shelter provides protection
- Most can stay dry and warm with adequate shelter
- Some exposure may be unavoidable

WITHOUT PROPER PROTECTION:
- Hypothermia is likely
- May not be preventable
- Some will develop hypothermia
- Focus on best available protection

PROTECTION EFFECTIVENESS:
- Good shelter: Prevents most exposure
- Adequate shelter: Reduces exposure significantly
- Poor shelter: Some protection, but risk remains
- No shelter: Hypothermia likely

DO NOT:
- DO NOT stay in wet clothing
- DO NOT stay in wind
- DO NOT ignore wind chill
- DO NOT lie on wet ground
- DO NOT ignore early hypothermia signs → Medical RAG
- DO NOT delay getting to shelter
- DO NOT become complacent

MYTHS CORRECTED:
- "Wind is just uncomfortable" - FALSE: Wind significantly increases heat loss
- "A little wet won't hurt" - FALSE: Wet clothing increases heat loss 25x
- "You can dry out later" - FALSE: Must get dry immediately to prevent hypothermia
- "Wind doesn't matter if you're dry" - FALSE: Wind increases heat loss even when dry
