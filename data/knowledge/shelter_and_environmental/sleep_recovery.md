TITLE: Safe Sleep and Recovery in Survival Conditions

KEYWORDS: safe sleep, recovery, sleep position, overnight hypothermia, moisture control, fatigue, exposure during sleep

SEVERITY LEVELS:
- Safe: Proper sleep conditions, adequate protection
- Risky: Some exposure risk during sleep
- Life-threatening: Severe exposure risk, hypothermia/heat illness during sleep

CROSS-RAG TRIGGERS:
- Hypothermia during sleep → Medical RAG (hypothermia.md) - IMMEDIATE
- Heat illness during sleep → Medical RAG (heat_stroke.md) - IMMEDIATE
- Unconscious during sleep → Medical RAG (airway_obstruction.md) - IMMEDIATE
- Dehydration → Food & Water RAG (hydration_requirements.md, dehydration.md) - IMMEDIATE

WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE:
- Sleeping in survival conditions
- Need to prevent exposure during sleep
- Overnight shelter concerns
- Fatigue and exposure interaction
- Recovery from injury or illness

IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES:
1. Preserve life - Exposure during sleep can be fatal
2. Prevent hypothermia during sleep
3. Maintain adequate protection
4. Monitor conditions
5. Ensure safe sleep position

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Hypothermia can develop during sleep
- Heat illness can develop during sleep
- Person may not wake if conditions worsen
- Fatigue increases exposure risk
- Time is critical: Monitor throughout night

STEP-BY-STEP ACTIONS:

1. PREPARE SLEEP AREA:
   - Insulate from ground (critical)
   - Ensure adequate protection from elements
   - Check for hazards
   - Ensure ventilation if using fire
   - Prepare before dark if possible

2. PREVENT OVERNIGHT HYPOTHERMIA:
   - Insulate from ground (minimum 6 inches/15cm if possible)
   - Create dead air space (layers of insulation)
   - Cover head (loses 40% of heat)
   - Cover all exposed skin
   - Maintain warmth throughout night

3. MANAGE MOISTURE DURING SLEEP:
   - Stay dry
   - Prevent condensation
   - Allow some ventilation
   - Remove wet clothing before sleep
   - Keep sleep area dry

4. SAFE SLEEP POSITION:
   - Position to maintain airway
   - Position to prevent pressure points
   - Position for comfort but safety
   - Do not sleep in position that restricts breathing
   - Consider recovery position if alone and unwell

5. MONITOR CONDITIONS:
   - Check periodically if possible
   - Monitor for hypothermia signs
   - Monitor for heat illness signs
   - Monitor fire if using
   - Adjust as needed

FOR SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENTS / CONDITIONS:

COLD CONDITIONS:
- Focus on preventing hypothermia
- Insulate from ground (critical)
- Create dead air space
- Cover completely
- Monitor for shivering
- If shivering stops → Medical RAG (hypothermia.md) - IMMEDIATE

HOT CONDITIONS:
- Focus on preventing heat illness
- Ensure ventilation
- Stay in shade
- Maintain hydration → Food & Water RAG
- Monitor for heat illness
- If no sweating, very hot → Medical RAG (heat_stroke.md) - IMMEDIATE

WET CONDITIONS:
- Focus on staying dry
- Insulate from wet ground
- Prevent water from entering
- Remove wet clothing
- Monitor for hypothermia → Medical RAG

WINDY CONDITIONS:
- Focus on wind protection
- Create wind barrier
- Minimize wind exposure
- Monitor for hypothermia → Medical RAG

VITAL SIGNS TO CHECK:

BEFORE SLEEP:
- Protection: Adequate or inadequate
- Ground insulation: Present or absent
- Moisture: Dry or wet
- Temperature: Comfortable or too cold/hot
- Ventilation: Adequate or inadequate

DURING SLEEP (IF POSSIBLE):
- Shivering: Early hypothermia sign → Warm person, Medical RAG if severe
- No shivering when should be cold: Serious hypothermia → Medical RAG (hypothermia.md) - IMMEDIATE
- Very hot, no sweating: Heat stroke → Medical RAG (heat_stroke.md) - IMMEDIATE
- Breathing: Normal or difficulty → Medical RAG if problems

AFTER SLEEP (MONITOR FOR):
- Hypothermia signs → Medical RAG (hypothermia.md) - IMMEDIATE
- Heat illness signs → Medical RAG (heat_stroke.md) - IMMEDIATE
- Dehydration → Food & Water RAG (hydration_requirements.md, dehydration.md)

WHEN PROFESSIONAL HELP IS UNAVAILABLE:

WHAT YOU CAN DO:
- Prepare sleep area properly
- Insulate from ground (critical)
- Maintain protection
- Monitor if possible
- If exposure develops → Medical RAG

REALITY CHECK:
- Some exposure may be unavoidable
- Person may not wake if conditions worsen
- Focus on prevention
- Monitor if possible
- Some may develop exposure despite best efforts

LONG-TERM CARE:

MAINTAIN SLEEP CONDITIONS:
- Keep sleep area in good condition
- Maintain insulation
- Maintain protection
- Monitor conditions
- Adapt as needed

RECOVERY:
- Adequate sleep aids recovery
- Protect during sleep
- Maintain conditions
- Monitor health
- See Medical RAG if needed

PREVENTION:

PREPARE BEFORE SLEEP:
- Prepare sleep area before dark
- Ensure adequate protection
- Insulate from ground
- Check conditions
- Prepare for overnight

RECOGNIZE RISK:
- Overnight exposure is dangerous
- Prepare adequately
- Do not ignore risks
- Monitor if possible
- Prevent exposure before sleep

REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS:

WITH PROPER PREPARATION:
- Overnight exposure can be prevented
- Proper preparation maintains protection
- Most can sleep safely with adequate preparation
- Some exposure may be unavoidable

WITHOUT PROPER PREPARATION:
- Overnight exposure is likely
- May not be preventable
- Some will develop exposure
- Focus on best available preparation

SLEEP PREPARATION:
- Good preparation: Prevents most exposure
- Adequate preparation: Reduces exposure significantly
- Poor preparation: Some protection, but risks remain
- No preparation: Exposure likely

DO NOT:
- DO NOT sleep directly on ground (conducts heat away)
- DO NOT ignore ground insulation (critical)
- DO NOT sleep in wet clothing
- DO NOT ignore overnight exposure risk
- DO NOT assume you will wake if conditions worsen
- DO NOT skip preparation
- DO NOT become complacent

MYTHS CORRECTED:
- "You'll wake up if you get too cold" - FALSE: Hypothermia can prevent waking
- "Ground doesn't matter for sleep" - FALSE: Ground conducts heat away, insulation critical
- "A little cold won't hurt overnight" - FALSE: Overnight exposure can be fatal
- "Sleep position doesn't matter" - FALSE: Position affects breathing and exposure
