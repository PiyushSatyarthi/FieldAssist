TITLE: Hypothermia Prevention and Shelter

KEYWORDS: hypothermia, cold exposure, shelter, insulation, wind protection, moisture management, cold weather survival

SEVERITY LEVELS:
- Mild: Shivering, alert, can help self
- Serious: Shivering stops, confusion, difficulty moving
- Life-threatening: No shivering, unconscious, slow/irregular breathing, very low temperature

CROSS-RAG TRIGGERS:
- Hypothermia develops → Medical RAG (hypothermia.md) - IMMEDIATE
- Shivering stops → Medical RAG (hypothermia.md) - IMMEDIATE
- Unconscious from cold → Medical RAG (hypothermia.md, airway_obstruction.md) - IMMEDIATE
- Frostbite → Medical RAG (frostbite.md)
- Dehydration from cold → Food & Water RAG (hydration_requirements.md)

WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE:
- Exposure to cold temperatures
- Need to prevent hypothermia
- Building shelter in cold conditions
- Person is wet and cold
- No access to heated shelter
- Cold weather survival situation

IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES:
1. Preserve life - Hypothermia can be fatal
2. Remove from cold immediately
3. Prevent further heat loss
4. Create or find shelter
5. Get dry and warm

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Hypothermia can cause death
- Wet clothing increases heat loss dramatically
- Wind increases heat loss significantly
- Cold ground conducts heat away
- Time is critical: Hypothermia can develop in hours or minutes

STEP-BY-STEP ACTIONS:

1. REMOVE FROM COLD:
   - Get to shelter immediately
   - Get out of wind
   - Get out of wet conditions
   - Do NOT delay - every minute matters
   - If cannot move: Create shelter where you are

2. REMOVE WET CLOTHING:
   - Wet clothing increases heat loss 25x
   - Remove wet clothing immediately
   - Replace with dry clothing if available
   - If no dry clothing: Remove wet, wrap in whatever available
   - Do NOT stay in wet clothing

3. CREATE OR FIND SHELTER:
   - Get out of wind (wind increases heat loss)
   - Get off cold ground (ground conducts heat)
   - Create barrier from elements
   - Use natural shelter if available (caves, overhangs)
   - Build shelter if necessary (see shelter_basics.md)

4. INSULATE FROM GROUND:
   - Ground conducts heat away
   - Place insulating material between body and ground
   - Use: Leaves, branches, clothing, whatever available
   - Thickness matters - more is better
   - Do NOT lie directly on ground

5. CREATE DEAD AIR SPACE:
   - Air is good insulator if trapped
   - Create layers of clothing/blankets
   - Use multiple layers
   - Trap air between layers
   - Cover completely except face

6. PREVENT HEAT LOSS:
   - Cover head (loses 40% of heat)
   - Cover extremities (hands, feet)
   - Cover all exposed skin
   - Minimize exposed areas
   - Keep covered even if uncomfortable

FOR SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENTS / CONDITIONS:

COLD AND WET:
- HIGHEST RISK - wet increases heat loss dramatically
- Remove wet clothing immediately
- Get dry as quickly as possible
- Create shelter from rain/wet
- Prevent further wetting

COLD AND WINDY:
- Wind increases heat loss significantly
- Get out of wind immediately
- Create wind barrier
- Shelter behind natural windbreaks
- Build wind-resistant shelter

COLD AND SNOW:
- Snow can provide insulation if used properly
- Get out of wet snow
- Create shelter in snow if necessary
- Stay dry
- Prevent contact with cold snow

COLD AT NIGHT:
- Temperature drops at night
- Need extra insulation
- Monitor throughout night
- Check for hypothermia signs
- Maintain warmth

COLD AND INJURED:
- Injury increases hypothermia risk
- Keep injured person warm
- Prevent further injury
- Monitor closely
- See appropriate Medical RAG guides

VITAL SIGNS TO CHECK:

SHIVERING:
- Mild: Shivering present, person alert → Monitor, maintain warmth
- Moderate: Shivering stops, person confused → Medical RAG (hypothermia.md) - IMMEDIATE
- Severe: No shivering, person unconscious → Medical RAG (hypothermia.md, airway_obstruction.md) - IMMEDIATE

CONSCIOUSNESS:
- Mild: Alert, can help self
- Moderate: Confused, slurred speech → Medical RAG (hypothermia.md)
- Severe: Unconscious → Medical RAG (hypothermia.md, airway_obstruction.md) - IMMEDIATE

SKIN TEMPERATURE:
- Mild: Cold to touch
- Moderate: Very cold
- Severe: Extremely cold, may feel dead → Medical RAG (hypothermia.md) - IMMEDIATE

BREATHING:
- Mild: Normal
- Moderate: Slow, shallow → Medical RAG (hypothermia.md)
- Severe: Very slow, irregular, may stop → Medical RAG (hypothermia.md, airway_obstruction.md) - IMMEDIATE

COORDINATION:
- Mild: Can move, some clumsiness
- Moderate: Difficulty moving, stumbling → Medical RAG (hypothermia.md)
- Severe: Cannot move, rigid → Medical RAG (hypothermia.md) - IMMEDIATE

WHEN PROFESSIONAL HELP IS UNAVAILABLE:

WHAT YOU CAN DO:
- Remove from cold immediately
- Remove wet clothing
- Create shelter
- Insulate from ground
- Create dead air space
- Monitor for hypothermia → Medical RAG if develops

REALITY CHECK:
- Some hypothermia may be unavoidable
- Focus on prevention
- Act quickly
- Some may not survive despite best efforts

LONG-TERM CARE:

MAINTAIN SHELTER:
- Keep shelter in good condition
- Maintain insulation
- Prevent moisture
- Monitor for problems
- Adapt as needed

MONITOR CONTINUOUSLY:
- Check for hypothermia signs
- Maintain warmth
- Prevent moisture
- Monitor throughout exposure

PREVENTION:

PREPARE BEFORE COLD:
- Know how to build shelter
- Have materials if possible
- Know location of shelter sites
- Prepare for cold exposure
- Have dry clothing if possible

RECOGNIZE EARLY SIGNS:
- Shivering is first sign
- Act before shivering stops
- Do not ignore cold exposure
- Get to shelter early
- Prevent hypothermia before it develops

REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS:

WITH PROPER SHELTER:
- Hypothermia can be prevented
- Proper insulation maintains warmth
- Most can stay warm with adequate shelter
- Some cold exposure may be unavoidable

WITHOUT PROPER SHELTER:
- Hypothermia is likely
- May not be preventable
- Some will develop hypothermia
- Focus on best available shelter

SHELTER EFFECTIVENESS:
- Good shelter: Prevents most heat loss
- Adequate shelter: Reduces heat loss significantly
- Poor shelter: Some protection, but hypothermia risk remains
- No shelter: Hypothermia likely

DO NOT:
- DO NOT stay in wet clothing
- DO NOT lie directly on cold ground
- DO NOT ignore wind (increases heat loss)
- DO NOT ignore early hypothermia signs → Medical RAG
- DO NOT remove clothing if already cold (trap what heat you have)
- DO NOT use alcohol (increases heat loss)
- DO NOT become complacent

MYTHS CORRECTED:
- "Fire indoors is always safe" - FALSE: Can cause CO poisoning, see fire_safety.md
- "Rubbing limbs warms them" - FALSE: Can cause injury, does not help
- "Alcohol warms you" - FALSE: Increases heat loss, dangerous
- "You can't get hypothermia above freezing" - FALSE: Can occur in temperatures above freezing if wet/windy
