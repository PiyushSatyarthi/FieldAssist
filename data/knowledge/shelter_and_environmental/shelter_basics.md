TITLE: Shelter Basics - Temporary Shelter Construction

KEYWORDS: shelter construction, temporary shelter, emergency shelter, ground insulation, wind protection, moisture management, ventilation

SEVERITY LEVELS:
- Adequate: Shelter provides protection from elements
- Inadequate: Shelter provides some protection but risks remain
- Dangerous: Shelter does not provide adequate protection, exposure risk high

CROSS-RAG TRIGGERS:
- Hypothermia develops → Medical RAG (hypothermia.md) - IMMEDIATE
- Heat illness develops → Medical RAG (heat_stroke.md) - IMMEDIATE
- Burns from fire → Medical RAG (burns.md)
- Smoke/CO exposure → Medical RAG (smoke_carbon_monoxide.md) - IMMEDIATE

WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE:
- Need to build temporary shelter
- No access to permanent shelter
- Exposure to elements
- Survival or disaster situation
- Need protection from weather

IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES:
1. Preserve life - Shelter prevents exposure deaths
2. Protect from elements immediately
3. Insulate from ground (critical, often missed)
4. Prevent wind exposure
5. Manage moisture

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Exposure to elements can cause hypothermia or heat illness
- Cold ground conducts heat away
- Wind increases heat loss significantly
- Moisture increases heat loss dramatically
- Time is critical: Build shelter before exposure becomes severe

STEP-BY-STEP ACTIONS:

1. CHOOSE LOCATION:
   - High ground (avoids flooding)
   - Protected from wind
   - Natural windbreaks if available
   - Away from hazards (falling rocks, dead trees)
   - Near resources if possible (water, materials)
   - Do NOT choose low areas (cold air sinks, flooding risk)

2. INSULATE FROM GROUND (CRITICAL):
   - Ground conducts heat away
   - Place insulating material between body and ground
   - Use: Leaves, branches, clothing, whatever available
   - Thickness matters - minimum 6 inches (15cm) if possible
   - More is better
   - Do NOT lie directly on ground

3. CREATE WIND BARRIER:
   - Wind increases heat loss significantly
   - Build barrier from wind
   - Use natural materials (branches, leaves, debris)
   - Create wall or lean-to structure
   - Minimize wind exposure

4. CREATE ROOF/COVER:
   - Protect from rain/sun
   - Use available materials
   - Create sloped roof if possible (sheds water)
   - Overlap materials to prevent leaks
   - Do NOT make completely airtight (need ventilation)

5. MANAGE MOISTURE:
   - Keep shelter area dry
   - Prevent water from entering
   - Allow some ventilation to prevent condensation
   - Remove wet materials
   - Stay dry inside shelter

6. MAINTAIN VENTILATION:
   - Need some air movement
   - Prevents condensation
   - Prevents CO buildup if using fire
   - But minimize wind exposure
   - Balance ventilation with protection

FOR SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENTS / CONDITIONS:

COLD CONDITIONS:
- Focus on insulation and wind protection
- Insulate from ground (critical)
- Create wind barrier
- Minimize openings
- Maintain some ventilation
- Monitor for hypothermia → Medical RAG

HOT CONDITIONS:
- Focus on shade and ventilation
- Create shade from sun
- Maximize ventilation
- Minimize heat buildup
- Stay in shade during hottest hours
- Monitor for heat illness → Medical RAG

WET CONDITIONS:
- Focus on staying dry
- Create waterproof cover
- Insulate from wet ground
- Prevent water from entering
- Remove wet clothing
- Monitor for hypothermia → Medical RAG

WINDY CONDITIONS:
- Focus on wind protection
- Create wind barrier
- Use natural windbreaks
- Minimize wind exposure
- Maintain some ventilation
- Monitor for hypothermia → Medical RAG

VITAL SIGNS TO CHECK:

SHELTER EFFECTIVENESS:
- Protection from elements: Adequate or inadequate
- Ground insulation: Present or absent
- Wind protection: Adequate or inadequate
- Moisture: Dry or wet
- Ventilation: Adequate or inadequate

PERSON CONDITION:
- Shivering: Shelter may be inadequate → Improve shelter, Medical RAG if severe
- Too hot: Shelter may trap heat → Improve ventilation, Medical RAG if heat illness
- Wet: Shelter not protecting → Improve shelter, remove wet clothing
- Comfortable: Shelter adequate → Monitor, maintain

AFTER USING SHELTER (MONITOR FOR):
- Hypothermia signs → Medical RAG (hypothermia.md) - IMMEDIATE
- Heat illness signs → Medical RAG (heat_stroke.md) - IMMEDIATE
- Smoke/CO exposure → Medical RAG (smoke_carbon_monoxide.md) - IMMEDIATE

WHEN PROFESSIONAL HELP IS UNAVAILABLE:

WHAT YOU CAN DO:
- Build best shelter possible with available materials
- Focus on ground insulation (critical)
- Protect from wind and elements
- Manage moisture
- Monitor for exposure → Medical RAG if develops

REALITY CHECK:
- Shelter may not be perfect
- Do best with available materials
- Some exposure may be unavoidable
- Focus on most critical elements
- Ground insulation is often missed but critical

LONG-TERM CARE:

MAINTAIN SHELTER:
- Repair damage
- Improve as possible
- Maintain insulation
- Maintain protection
- Adapt to conditions

MONITOR EFFECTIVENESS:
- Check for problems
- Improve as needed
- Maintain standards
- Prevent deterioration
- Monitor person condition

PREVENTION:

PREPARE BEFORE NEED:
- Know how to build shelter
- Know location of materials
- Practice if possible
- Know multiple shelter types
- Prepare for conditions

RECOGNIZE NEED EARLY:
- Build shelter before exposure becomes severe
- Do not wait until hypothermia/heat illness develops
- Act early
- Prevent exposure before it occurs

REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS:

WITH PROPER SHELTER:
- Exposure can be prevented
- Proper shelter provides protection
- Most can stay protected with adequate shelter
- Some exposure may be unavoidable

WITHOUT PROPER SHELTER:
- Exposure is likely
- May not be preventable
- Some will develop exposure-related illness
- Focus on best available shelter

SHELTER QUALITY:
- Good shelter: Prevents most exposure
- Adequate shelter: Reduces exposure significantly
- Poor shelter: Some protection, but risks remain
- No shelter: Exposure likely

DO NOT:
- DO NOT lie directly on ground (conducts heat away)
- DO NOT ignore ground insulation (critical, often missed)
- DO NOT make shelter completely airtight (need ventilation, CO risk)
- DO NOT ignore wind (increases heat loss)
- DO NOT ignore moisture (increases heat loss)
- DO NOT delay building shelter
- DO NOT become complacent

MYTHS CORRECTED:
- "Any shelter is better than none" - FALSE: Poor shelter may not help, focus on critical elements
- "Ground doesn't matter" - FALSE: Ground conducts heat away, insulation is critical
- "Ventilation is optional" - FALSE: Need ventilation to prevent CO buildup and condensation
- "Shelter is just about roof" - FALSE: Ground insulation and wind protection are equally important
