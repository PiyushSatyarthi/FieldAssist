TITLE: Smoke Inhalation and Carbon Monoxide Poisoning

KEYWORDS: smoke inhalation, carbon monoxide, CO poisoning, indoor fire, ventilation, air quality, toxic fumes

SEVERITY LEVELS:
- Mild: Minor smoke exposure, some coughing, no breathing problems
- Serious: Significant smoke exposure, difficulty breathing, but person alert
- Life-threatening: Severe smoke/CO exposure, cannot breathe, loss of consciousness, respiratory arrest

CROSS-RAG TRIGGERS:
- Difficulty breathing from smoke → Medical RAG (airway_obstruction.md, respiratory_illness.md) - IMMEDIATE
- Unconscious from smoke/CO → Medical RAG (airway_obstruction.md) - IMMEDIATE
- Respiratory arrest → Medical RAG (airway_obstruction.md) - IMMEDIATE
- Burns from fire → Medical RAG (burns.md)
- CO poisoning symptoms → Medical RAG (requires immediate removal from source)

WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE:
- Fire in enclosed space
- Smoke present
- Using fire for heat in shelter
- Suspecting carbon monoxide exposure
- Person has breathing problems after fire exposure
- Headache, confusion after fire exposure

IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES:
1. Preserve life - Smoke/CO can kill within minutes
2. Get to fresh air immediately
3. Remove from source
4. Ensure adequate ventilation
5. Monitor breathing

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Carbon monoxide is odorless and can kill silently
- Smoke inhalation can cause respiratory failure
- Both can cause death within minutes
- Enclosed spaces trap toxic gases
- Time is critical: Get to fresh air immediately

STEP-BY-STEP ACTIONS:

1. GET TO FRESH AIR IMMEDIATELY:
   - Leave enclosed space immediately
   - Get to open air
   - Do NOT delay - every second counts
   - If person cannot move: Remove them
   - Do NOT return to contaminated area

2. IF PERSON IS UNCONSCIOUS:
   - Remove to fresh air immediately
   - Check breathing → Medical RAG (airway_obstruction.md)
   - Begin rescue breathing if not breathing → Medical RAG (airway_obstruction.md) - IMMEDIATE
   - Continue until person responds or help arrives
   - Do NOT enter dangerous area alone

3. ENSURE ADEQUATE VENTILATION:
   - Fire in enclosed space requires ventilation
   - Open windows/doors if safe
   - Create ventilation openings
   - Monitor air quality
   - Do NOT use fire in unventilated space

4. MONITOR FOR SYMPTOMS:
   - Watch for breathing problems
   - Watch for confusion or headache
   - Watch for loss of consciousness
   - Monitor continuously
   - Act immediately if symptoms develop

FOR SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENTS / CONDITIONS:

INDOOR FIRE:
- HIGH RISK - enclosed space traps smoke and CO
- Requires adequate ventilation
- Monitor air quality continuously
- Have escape route
- Do NOT use in unventilated space

FIRE IN SHELTER:
- Must have ventilation
- Monitor for smoke buildup
- Have escape route
- Do NOT seal shelter completely
- Monitor continuously

SMOKE FROM EXTERNAL FIRE:
- May enter shelter
- Monitor air quality
- Evacuate if necessary
- Seek upwind location
- Protect from smoke

CARBON MONOXIDE FROM FIRE:
- Odorless and deadly
- Can build up in enclosed spaces
- Requires ventilation
- Monitor for symptoms
- Evacuate if symptoms develop

VITAL SIGNS TO CHECK:

BREATHING:
- Normal: No difficulty → Monitor
- Moderate: Some difficulty, coughing → Medical RAG (respiratory_illness.md)
- Severe: Severe difficulty, cannot breathe → Medical RAG (airway_obstruction.md) - IMMEDIATE

CONSCIOUSNESS:
- Normal: Alert → Monitor
- Moderate: Confused, headache → Medical RAG, remove from source immediately
- Severe: Unconscious → Medical RAG (airway_obstruction.md) - IMMEDIATE

CO POISONING SIGNS:
- Headache → Remove from source immediately, Medical RAG
- Dizziness → Remove from source immediately, Medical RAG
- Nausea → Remove from source immediately, Medical RAG
- Confusion → Remove from source immediately, Medical RAG
- Loss of consciousness → Medical RAG (airway_obstruction.md) - IMMEDIATE

SMOKE EXPOSURE SIGNS:
- Coughing → Monitor, ensure fresh air
- Difficulty breathing → Medical RAG (respiratory_illness.md)
- Hoarse voice → Medical RAG (respiratory_illness.md)
- Soot in nose/mouth → Medical RAG (respiratory_illness.md)

WHEN PROFESSIONAL HELP IS UNAVAILABLE:

WHAT YOU CAN DO:
- Get to fresh air immediately
- Ensure adequate ventilation
- Monitor for symptoms
- Remove from source if symptoms develop
- If breathing problems → Medical RAG (airway_obstruction.md)

REALITY CHECK:
- CO poisoning can be fatal
- Some may not survive despite removal from source
- Focus on prevention
- Adequate ventilation is critical

LONG-TERM CARE:

MAINTAIN VENTILATION:
- Keep ventilation adequate
- Monitor air quality
- Prevent smoke/CO buildup
- Maintain escape routes
- Monitor continuously

MONITOR FOR DELAYED EFFECTS:
- Some effects may be delayed
- Monitor for breathing problems
- Monitor for neurological symptoms
- Watch for complications
- See Medical RAG if symptoms develop

PREVENTION:

ADEQUATE VENTILATION:
- Fire in enclosed space requires ventilation
- Create ventilation openings
- Monitor air quality
- Do NOT use fire in unventilated space
- Maintain ventilation

MONITOR CONTINUOUSLY:
- Watch for smoke buildup
- Watch for symptoms
- Monitor air quality
- Have escape plan
- Act immediately if problems

REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS:

WITH PROPER VENTILATION:
- Smoke/CO exposure can be minimized
- Proper ventilation prevents buildup
- Most can use fire safely with ventilation
- Some risk remains

WITHOUT PROPER VENTILATION:
- CO poisoning is likely
- May be fatal
- Do NOT use fire in unventilated space
- Focus on adequate ventilation

VENTILATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Fire needs adequate air flow
- Must allow smoke/CO to escape
- Must allow fresh air to enter
- Monitor continuously
- Do NOT seal completely

DO NOT:
- DO NOT use fire in unventilated enclosed space
- DO NOT ignore smoke buildup
- DO NOT ignore symptoms (headache, confusion)
- DO NOT return to contaminated area
- DO NOT delay getting to fresh air
- DO NOT assume fire is safe indoors
- DO NOT ignore breathing problems → Medical RAG

MYTHS CORRECTED:
- "Fire indoors is always safe if small" - FALSE: Even small fires produce CO, need ventilation
- "You can see/smell CO" - FALSE: CO is odorless and invisible
- "A little smoke won't hurt" - FALSE: Smoke can cause respiratory problems
- "Ventilation is optional" - FALSE: Ventilation is mandatory for indoor fires
