2. ASSESS SIGNALING RISKS:
   - Position revelation: Will signaling reveal position?
   - Threat attraction: Will signaling attract threats?
   - Fire risk: Will signaling cause fire?
   - Resource risk: Will signaling waste resources?
   - Exhaustion risk: Will signaling cause exhaustion?
   - Injury risk: Will signaling cause injury?
   - If risks high: Signaling may be dangerous
   - If risks outweigh benefits: Do not signal
   - Do not ignore risks: Risks are real

3. ASSESS SIGNALING NECESSITY:
   - Is signaling required? Is rescue likely?
   - Can you survive without signaling? Is signaling essential?
   - What happens if you do not signal? Can you wait?
   - What happens if you do signal? Will threats attack?
   - If signaling not essential: Consider not signaling
   - If threats present: Consider not signaling
   - Do not signal unnecessarily: Unnecessary signaling is risky

4. COMPARE RISKS:
   - Signaling risks: What are risks of signaling?
   - Not signaling risks: What are risks of not signaling?
   - Which is safer? Signaling or not signaling?
   - Which has lower risk? Compare risks
   - If not signaling safer: Do not signal
   - If signaling safer: Signal carefully
   - Do not ignore comparison: Comparison prevents mistakes

5. MAKE DECISION:
   - Based on assessment: Use assessment to decide
   - Prioritize safety: Safety is most important
   - Consider all factors: All factors matter
   - Choose safer option: Choose option with lower risk
   - Do not signal if unsafe: Safety is priority
   - Do not ignore threats: Threats are real danger
   - Do not make decision without assessment: Assessment prevents mistakes

6. IF SIGNALING: USE SAFEST METHOD:
   - Choose least visible: Least visible signals safest
   - Choose least audible: Least audible signals safest
   - Choose controlled: Controlled signals safest
   - Choose temporary: Temporary signals safest
   - Use maximum caution: Extra caution when threats present
   - Do not use obvious signals: Obvious signals reveal position
   - Do not use continuous signals: Continuous signals reveal position
   - Do not ignore safety: Safety is priority

7. IF NOT SIGNALING: FIND ALTERNATIVES:
   - Self-rescue: Can you rescue yourself?
   - Wait: Can you wait for better conditions?
   - Move: Can you move to safer location?
   - Hide: Can you hide and wait?
   - Do not give up: Alternatives may exist
   - Do not ignore alternatives: Alternatives may be better

8. MONITOR SITUATION:
   - Watch threats: Are threats still present?
   - Watch conditions: Have conditions changed?
   - Watch opportunities: Are opportunities available?
   - Adjust decision: Change decision as needed
   - Do not ignore changes: Changes affect decision
   - Do not be rigid: Rigidity causes problems

FOR SPECIFIC THREATS:

HUMAN THREATS:
- Do not signal: Signaling reveals position
- Hide: Hide and wait
- Move: Move to safer location
- Self-rescue: Attempt self-rescue
- Do not reveal position: Position revelation is dangerous
- Do not attract attention: Attention attracts threats

ANIMAL THREATS:
- Assess threat: Is animal dangerous?
- If dangerous: Do not signal, avoid
- If not dangerous: May signal if safe
