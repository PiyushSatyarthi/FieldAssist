FOR SPECIFIC SITUATIONS:

COMMUNICATING DURING MOVEMENT:
- Use hand signals: Visual signals for movement

- Maintain spacing: Proper spacing for communication
- Check regularly: Regular check-ins during movement
- Do not lose contact: Maintain group contact
- Do not ignore spacing: Spacing affects communication

COMMUNICATING DURING REST:
- Establish watch: Rotating watch for communication
- Use signals: Signals for communication
- Check regularly: Regular check-ins during rest
