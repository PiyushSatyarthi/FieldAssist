TITLE: Signaling Priorities in Survival Situations

KEYWORDS: signaling priorities, communication priorities, signal prioritization, emergency priorities, rescue priorities, communication urgency, signal importance, priority communication

SEVERITY LEVELS:
- Low: Routine communication, non-urgent signaling, good conditions
- Serious: Important communication, moderate urgency, poor conditions
- Critical: Emergency communication, immediate urgency, harsh conditions

PRIMARY DOMAIN: communication_and_signaling

CROSS-RAG TRIGGERS:
- Emergency requiring immediate signaling → Communication & Signaling RAG (distress_signals.md, visual_signaling.md, audible_signaling.md)
- Security risks from signaling → Security & Personal Safety RAG (threat_avoidance.md, when_signaling_dangerous.md)
- Stress from priority decisions → Psychological Survival RAG (stress_management.md, decision_fatigue.md)
- Resource allocation for signaling → Food & Water RAG (all files as applicable)

WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE:
- Deciding what to signal
- Prioritizing communication needs
- When multiple signals are needed
- When resources are limited
- When time is limited
- When signaling decisions are critical
- When professional communication is unavailable
- When signaling priorities affect survival

IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES:
1. Assess situation urgency: How urgent is communication?
2. Assess signal importance: What signals are most important?
3. Assess resource availability: What resources are available?
4. Prioritize signals: Rank signals by importance
5. Execute priority signals: Signal most important first
6. Monitor priorities: Adjust priorities as needed
7. Conserve resources: Do not waste on low priorities
8. Adapt priorities: Change priorities as situation changes

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Wrong priorities: Wrong priorities waste resources and time
- Delayed critical signals: Delay can be fatal
- Resource waste: Signaling low priorities wastes resources
- Time waste: Signaling low priorities wastes time
- Missed opportunities: Wrong priorities miss important signals
- Exhaustion: Signaling everything exhausts quickly
- Threat exposure: Signaling everything may attract threats
- Signal failure: Too many signals may cause failure
- Confusion: Too many signals cause confusion
- Failure: Wrong priorities can cause group failure

STEP-BY-STEP ACTIONS:

1. ASSESS SITUATION URGENCY (DO FIRST):

   - Immediate need: Is immediate help needed?
   - Time critical: Is time critical?
   - Resource critical: Are resources critically low?
   - Threat present: Are threats present?
   - Do not delay life-threatening: Delay can be fatal
   - Do not ignore urgency: Urgency affects priorities
   - Do not signal non-urgent first: Urgent signals first

2. ASSESS SIGNAL IMPORTANCE:
   - Distress signals: Most important for rescue
   - Emergency signals: Important for emergencies
   - Status signals: Important for coordination
   - Routine signals: Less important for routine
   - Rank by importance: Most important first
   - Do not ignore importance: Importance affects priorities
   - Do not signal low importance first: High importance first

3. ASSESS RESOURCE AVAILABILITY:
   - Energy: How much energy available?
   - Materials: What materials available?
   - Time: How much time available?
   - Capability: What capability available?
   - If resources limited: Prioritize carefully
   - If resources adequate: Can signal more
   - Do not waste resources: Resources may be limited

4. PRIORITIZE SIGNALS:
   - Life-threatening first: Life-threatening signals highest priority
   - Emergency second: Emergency signals second priority
   - Important third: Important signals third priority
   - Routine last: Routine signals lowest priority
   - Rank all signals: Complete priority list
   - Do not skip prioritization: Prioritization prevents waste
   - Do not ignore ranking: Ranking guides signaling

5. EXECUTE PRIORITY SIGNALS:
   - Signal highest priority first: Most important signals first
   - Maintain priority signals: Keep priority signals active
   - Monitor priority signals: Watch priority signals
   - Do not signal low priority first: High priority first
   - Do not ignore priorities: Priorities guide signaling

6. MONITOR PRIORITIES:
   - Watch situation: Situation may change
   - Watch resources: Resources may change
   - Watch conditions: Conditions may change
   - Adjust priorities: Change priorities as needed
   - Do not ignore changes: Changes affect priorities
   - Do not be rigid: Rigidity causes problems

7. CONSERVE RESOURCES:
   - Use resources for priorities: High priority signals only
   - Do not waste on low priorities: Low priorities waste resources
   - Do not exhaust resources: Resources may be needed later
   - Do not ignore conservation: Conservation extends capability

8. ADAPT PRIORITIES:
   - Adapt to situation: Adjust for situation changes
   - Adapt to resources: Adjust for resource changes
   - Adapt to conditions: Adjust for condition changes
   - Adapt to response: Adjust for response received
   - Do not ignore adaptation: Adaptation keeps priorities correct
   - Do not be rigid: Rigidity causes problems

FOR SPECIFIC PRIORITIES:

LIFE-THREATENING EMERGENCIES:
- Highest priority: Life-threatening signals highest priority
- Signal immediately: Immediate signaling required
- Use maximum resources: Use all available resources
- Maintain signal: Keep signal active
- Do not delay: Delay can be fatal
- Do not conserve: Life is priority

EMERGENCIES:
- High priority: Emergency signals high priority
- Signal soon: Signal as soon as possible
- Use adequate resources: Use adequate resources
- Maintain signal: Keep signal active
- Do not delay unnecessarily: Delay may worsen situation
- Do not ignore: Emergencies need signaling

IMPORTANT COMMUNICATION:
- Moderate priority: Important signals moderate priority
- Signal when possible: Signal when resources allow
- Use moderate resources: Use moderate resources
- Maintain if needed: Maintain if necessary
- Do not ignore: Important signals need signaling
- Do not waste excessive resources: Moderate resources only

ROUTINE COMMUNICATION:
- Low priority: Routine signals lowest priority
- Signal if resources allow: Signal only if resources allow
- Use minimal resources: Use minimal resources
- Do not prioritize: Routine signals lowest priority

WHEN PROFESSIONAL HELP IS UNAVAILABLE:

YOU MUST RELY ON YOUR OWN PRIORITIZATION:
- No professional communication guidance

- You are responsible for your own prioritization
- Group members depend on your prioritization
- Wrong priorities can be dangerous: Wrong priorities waste resources
- First aid knowledge is essential: Know how to treat priority-related problems
- Have first aid supplies ready: Bandages, treatment supplies
- Know when to adapt: Priorities must adapt to conditions
- If severe situation occurs → trigger appropriate RAGs

IMPROVISED PRIORITIZATION:
- Use available information: Any information helps
- Use knowledge: Understanding priority principles helps
- Use judgment: Judgment helps prioritization
- Use group: If in group, coordinate prioritization
- Use time: Slower, more careful prioritization
- Accept limitations: Some prioritization may be difficult
- Use multiple factors: Consider all factors
