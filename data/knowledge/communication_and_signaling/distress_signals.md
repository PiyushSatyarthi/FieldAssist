TITLE: Distress Signals in Survival Situations

KEYWORDS: distress signals, emergency signals, rescue signals, SOS signals, emergency communication, distress communication, rescue communication, emergency signaling

SEVERITY LEVELS:
- Low: Non-emergency communication, routine signaling, good conditions
- Serious: Emergency situation, urgent signaling needed, poor conditions
- Critical: Life-threatening emergency, immediate signaling required, harsh conditions

PRIMARY DOMAIN: communication_and_signaling

CROSS-RAG TRIGGERS:
- Fire hazards from distress signals → Shelter & Environmental RAG (fire_safety.md) and Medical RAG (burns.md)
- Exhaustion from signaling → Medical RAG (shock.md, dehydration.md)
- Stress from emergency → Psychological Survival RAG (panic_control.md, stress_management.md)
- Security risks from signals → Security & Personal Safety RAG (threat_avoidance.md, situational_awareness.md)
- Injury requiring distress signal → Medical RAG (all injury files as applicable)

WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE:
- In emergency situation requiring rescue
- When life is threatened
- When immediate help is needed
- When you need to signal distress
- When standard communication is unavailable
- When you must be found immediately
- When professional rescue may be available
- When distress signal is appropriate

IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES:
1. Assess emergency severity: How urgent is situation?
2. Assess rescue likelihood: Is rescue possible?
3. Assess signaling safety: Is signaling safe?
4. Select appropriate signal: Which signal is best?
5. Execute signal immediately: Create and maintain signals
6. Monitor for response: Watch and listen for rescue
7. Prepare for rescue: Be ready when rescue arrives
8. Conserve resources: Do not waste resources unnecessarily

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Delayed signaling: Delay can be fatal in emergencies
- Wrong signal: Wrong signal may not be recognized
- Signal failure: Failed signals waste time and resources
- Threat exposure: Signals may reveal position to threats
- Resource waste: Signaling wastes resources if no rescue
- False hope: Signaling may not work, causing disappointment
- Time waste: Signaling wastes time if no rescue
- Security risk: Signals may attract wrong attention
- Exhaustion: Maintaining signals is exhausting
- Injury: Signal creation can cause injury

STEP-BY-STEP ACTIONS:

1. ASSESS EMERGENCY SEVERITY (DO FIRST):
   - Is situation life-threatening? Immediate action required?
   - Is immediate help needed? Can you wait?
   - What is urgency? How urgent is rescue?
   - What happens if no rescue? Can you survive without rescue?
   - Do not delay in life-threatening situations: Delay can be fatal
   - Do not signal for non-emergencies: Reserve for true emergencies
   - Do not ignore urgency: Urgency affects signal selection

2. ASSESS RESCUE LIKELIHOOD:
   - Are rescuers searching? Will signals be seen or heard?
   - Is rescue possible? Is rescue within capability?
   - How long until rescue? Can you survive until rescue?
   - If rescue unlikely: Consider alternatives to signaling
   - If rescue possible: Signal immediately
   - If rescue searching: Signal with maximum visibility/audibility

3. SELECT APPROPRIATE SIGNAL:
   - Visual signals: If rescuers may see (daylight, clear conditions)
   - Audible signals: If rescuers may hear (within hearing range)
   - Combined signals: Both visual and audible if possible
   - Recognized patterns: SOS, three of anything (universal distress)
   - Choose signal appropriate for conditions
   - Choose signal you can maintain
   - Do not choose signal beyond capability

4. USE RECOGNIZED DISTRESS PATTERNS:
   - SOS: Three short, three long, three short (Morse code or pattern)
   - Three of anything: Three fires, three flashes, three blasts, three bangs
   - HELP: Large letters visible from air
   - Arrow: Arrow pointing to your location
   - Ground markers: Large visible markers
   - Use patterns rescuers will recognize
   - Do not use unrecognized patterns: Unrecognized patterns may not be understood
   - Do not ignore patterns: Recognized patterns are more effective

5. EXECUTE SIGNAL IMMEDIATELY:
   - Create signal quickly: Time may be critical
   - Make signal large/loud: Maximum visibility/audibility
   - Make signal contrasting: Contrast with background
   - Use recognized pattern: Recognized patterns are more effective
   - Maintain signal: Keep signal active
   - Do not delay: Delay can be fatal
   - Do not create weak signal: Weak signals may not be seen/heard

6. MAINTAIN SIGNAL:
   - Keep signal active: Maintained signals work better
   - Monitor signal: Watch for deterioration
   - Repair signal: Fix problems immediately
   - Do not let signal fail: Failed signals waste effort
   - Do not ignore maintenance: Maintenance keeps signals working

7. MONITOR FOR RESPONSE:
   - Watch for rescuers: Look for approaching rescuers
   - Listen for rescuers: Listen for approaching rescuers
   - Watch for signals: Look for response signals
   - Listen for signals: Listen for response signals
   - Maintain awareness: Continuous awareness for response
   - Do not give up: Rescuers may take time
   - Do not ignore response: Response may be subtle

8. PREPARE FOR RESCUE:
   - Be visible: Make yourself visible to rescuers
   - Be ready: Be ready to assist rescue
   - Have information ready: Location, condition, needs
   - Do not hide: Hiding makes rescue harder
   - Do not ignore preparation: Preparation helps rescue

FOR SPECIFIC EMERGENCIES:

LIFE-THREATENING INJURY:
- Signal immediately: Time is critical
- Use maximum visibility/audibility: Maximum signal strength
- Maintain signal: Keep signal active
- Prepare for rescue: Be ready for medical rescue
- Do not delay: Delay can be fatal
- Do not give up: Maintain signal until rescue

LOST AND DISORIENTED:
- Signal for rescue: Signal your location
- Stay in place: Do not wander
- Use ground signals: Large visible markers
- Use audible signals: If rescuers are searching
- Do not wander: Wandering makes rescue harder
- Do not give up: Maintain signal until rescue

ENVIRONMENTAL EMERGENCY:
- Signal immediately: Environmental emergencies are urgent
- Use appropriate signal: Signal appropriate for conditions
- Maintain signal: Keep signal active
- Prepare for rescue: Be ready for rescue
- Do not delay: Delay can be fatal
- Do not ignore conditions: Conditions affect signaling

RESOURCE EMERGENCY:
- Signal if rescue possible: If rescue can provide resources
- Consider alternatives: If rescue unlikely, consider alternatives
- Use appropriate signal: Signal appropriate for situation
- Do not signal unnecessarily: Unnecessary signaling wastes resources

- Time: How much time available?
- These signs indicate emergency severity

RESCUE LIKELIHOOD:
- Rescuers: Are rescuers searching?
- Possibility: Is rescue possible?
- Time: How long until rescue?
- These signs indicate rescue likelihood

SIGNAL EFFECTIVENESS:
- Visibility: Can signals be seen?

WHEN PROFESSIONAL HELP IS UNAVAILABLE:

YOU MUST RELY ON YOUR OWN SIGNALING:
