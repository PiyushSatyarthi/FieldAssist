   - Is signaling safe? Will signals attract threats?
   - What are risks of signaling? Do risks outweigh benefits?
   - Can you signal effectively? Do you have materials and capability?
   - Do not signal unless necessary: Unnecessary signaling wastes resources
   - Do not signal if unsafe: Safety is priority
   - Do not signal if no one will see: Wastes resources

2. ASSESS SIGNALING SAFETY:
   - Fire safety: Can you control signal fires?
   - Threat safety: Will signals attract threats?
   - Environmental safety: Will signals damage environment?
   - Resource safety: Can you afford to use resources?
   - If signaling is unsafe: Do not signal, find safer method
   - If threats are present: Consider not signaling
   - If fire risk is high: Consider not using fire signals

3. ASSESS VISIBILITY:
   - Weather: Is weather suitable for visibility?
   - Time: Is it day or night? What signals work best?
   - Distance: How far away are potential rescuers?
   - Terrain: Does terrain allow visibility?
   - If visibility is poor: Signals may not be seen
   - If too far: Signals may not be visible
   - If terrain blocks: Signals may not be seen

4. SELECT SIGNALING METHOD:

5. PREPARE SIGNALING MATERIALS:
   - Gather materials: Fire materials, mirrors, flags, markers
   - Prepare materials: Cut, shape, prepare as needed
   - Test materials: Ensure materials work
   - Have backup: Multiple signaling methods if possible
   - Do not start without materials: Incomplete signals fail
   - Do not waste materials: Materials may be limited

6. CREATE SIGNALS:
   - Signal fires: Build fires that produce smoke (day) or light (night)
   - Signal mirrors: Reflect sunlight toward rescuers
   - Signal flags: Create visible flags or markers
   - Ground signals: Create large visible markers
   - Light signals: Use flashlights or fires at night
   - Use recognized patterns: SOS, three of anything (fires, flashes, etc.)
   - Make signals large: Larger signals are more visible
   - Make signals contrasting: Contrast with background
   - Do not create weak signals: Weak signals may not be seen
   - Do not ignore patterns: Recognized patterns are more effective

7. MAINTAIN SIGNALS:
   - Keep fires burning: Maintain signal fires
   - Keep mirrors ready: Have mirrors ready for use
   - Keep flags visible: Maintain flag visibility
   - Keep ground signals visible: Maintain ground signal visibility
   - Monitor signals: Watch for deterioration
   - Do not let signals fail: Failed signals waste effort
   - Do not ignore maintenance: Maintenance keeps signals working

8. MONITOR FOR RESPONSE:
   - Watch for rescuers: Look for approaching rescuers
   - Watch for signals: Look for response signals
   - Listen for sounds: Listen for aircraft, vehicles, voices
   - Maintain awareness: Continuous awareness for response
   - Do not give up too soon: Rescuers may take time
   - Do not ignore response: Response may be subtle

FOR SPECIFIC SIGNALING METHODS:

SIGNAL FIRES:
- Build in open area: Open area improves visibility
- Build multiple fires: Three fires signal distress
- Use green vegetation: Green vegetation produces smoke
- Use dry materials: Dry materials produce flames
- Maintain fires: Keep fires burning
- Control fires: Prevent wildfires
- Do not build in forest: Forest fires are dangerous
- Do not lose control: Controlled fires only

SIGNAL MIRRORS:
- Use in daylight: Mirrors work in daylight
- Aim at rescuers: Aim reflection at rescuers
- Flash pattern: Flash SOS or three flashes
- Use consistently: Consistent flashing is more visible

- Do not aim randomly: Aim at rescuers

SIGNAL FLAGS:
- Use bright colors: Bright colors are more visible
- Make large: Larger flags are more visible
- Wave flags: Waving flags are more visible
- Use recognized patterns: Recognized patterns are more effective
