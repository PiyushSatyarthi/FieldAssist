WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE:
- Threat has been identified through situational awareness
- Hostile individuals or groups are present
- Dangerous animals are encountered
- Environmental threats are approaching
- Conflict or violence is occurring nearby
- You need to avoid detection or confrontation
- Escape from dangerous situation is required
- Moving through areas with known threats
- When prevention is no longer possible and avoidance is needed

IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES:
1. Assess threat type and severity immediately
2. Determine if avoidance is possible or if confrontation is unavoidable
3. Identify all available avoidance routes and methods
4. Evaluate your physical capability to avoid (speed, endurance, obstacles)
5. Assess environmental conditions that affect avoidance (terrain, weather, visibility)
6. Determine if avoidance will expose you to other threats
7. Decide on avoidance method: Hide, flee, or blend in
8. Execute avoidance immediately if threat is immediate

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Delayed response: Hesitation allows threat to close distance
- Wrong direction: Moving toward greater danger instead of away
- Exposure: Avoidance method reveals your position
- Exhaustion: Overexertion during avoidance leaves you vulnerable
- Environmental hazards: Avoiding one threat by entering another danger zone
- Tunnel vision: Focusing on threat while missing escape route obstacles
- Panic: Fear causing poor decision-making or paralysis
- Group separation: Losing group members during avoidance
- Resource loss: Dropping supplies or tools needed for survival
- Injury during avoidance: Falls, cuts, or trauma while escaping
- Detection: Avoidance actions that draw attention instead of avoiding it

STEP-BY-STEP ACTIONS:

1. ASSESS THREAT IMMEDIATELY (DO FIRST):
   - Identify threat type: Human, animal, environmental, structural
   - Assess threat severity: Low, serious, or critical
   - Determine threat intent: Hostile, territorial, accidental, or unknown
   - Evaluate threat capability: Armed, unarmed, size, speed, numbers
   - Estimate threat distance: How close is immediate danger?
   - Assess threat awareness: Does threat know you are present?
   - Determine threat movement: Is threat approaching, stationary, or moving away?
   - Evaluate time available: Seconds, minutes, or hours to respond?
   - This assessment must occur in seconds, not minutes

2. DETERMINE AVOIDANCE METHOD (BASED ON THREAT TYPE):

   FOR HUMAN THREATS:
   - If threat has not detected you: Remain hidden, do not move
   - If threat is approaching: Move away quietly and quickly
   - If threat has detected you: Create distance immediately
   - If threat is armed: Maximum distance and cover are critical
   - If threat is in group: Avoid entire group, not just individuals
   - If threat is between you and safety: Find alternative route
   - If confrontation is unavoidable: See de-escalation principles
   - Priority: Avoid detection first, avoid confrontation second

   FOR ANIMAL THREATS:
   - Predators: Do not run (triggers chase), back away slowly, maintain eye contact if large predator
   - Territorial animals: Give wide berth, avoid direct approach
   - Aggressive domestic animals: Avoid eye contact, back away, do not turn and run
   - Venomous animals: Move away slowly, do not startle
   - If animal is feeding or with young: Maximum distance, do not approach
   - If animal is injured: May be more dangerous, avoid completely
   - If animal shows aggression: Back away, do not turn back until safe distance
   - Priority: Avoid provoking attack, create distance safely

   FOR ENVIRONMENTAL THREATS:
   - Fire: Move upwind and away, avoid canyons or dead ends
   - Flood: Move to high ground immediately, avoid low areas
   - Structural collapse: Move away from unstable structures
   - Chemical/biological: Move upwind, avoid contaminated areas
   - Weather: Seek shelter, avoid exposed areas
   - Terrain hazards: Avoid unstable ground, cliffs, fast water
   - Priority: Move to safety before threat reaches you

3. IDENTIFY AVOIDANCE ROUTES (MULTIPLE OPTIONS):
   - Primary route: Fastest path to safety
   - Secondary route: Alternative if primary blocked
   - Emergency route: Last resort if others fail
   - For each route, evaluate:
     * Distance to safety
     * Time required
     * Physical demands (can you do it?)
     * Obstacles or challenges
     * Visibility (will you be seen?)
     * Cover available (can you hide if needed?)
     * Other threats on route
   - Choose route that balances speed with safety
   - Do not choose route that exposes you to other threats
   - Reassess routes as you move - conditions change

4. EXECUTE AVOIDANCE (BASED ON METHOD CHOSEN):

   HIDING (IF THREAT HAS NOT DETECTED YOU):
   - Find concealment: Behind solid objects, in shadows, in vegetation
   - Ensure cover: Protection from projectiles if threat is armed
   - Remain absolutely still: Movement is detected before shape
   - Control breathing: Slow, quiet breaths
   - Control sounds: No rustling, talking, or equipment noise
   - Use available materials: Dirt, leaves, debris to break up outline
   - Position for observation: Can you see threat without being seen?
   - Prepare for movement: If discovered, can you escape quickly?
   - Wait until threat passes: Do not move until threat is clearly gone
   - Verify threat is gone: Wait additional time before emerging

   FLEEING (IF THREAT HAS DETECTED YOU OR IS IMMINENT):
   - Create distance immediately: Every meter matters
   - Move quickly but controlled: Do not fall or injure yourself
   - Use cover while moving: Trees, buildings, terrain features
   - Change direction: Zigzag pattern makes targeting difficult
   - Avoid open areas: Use terrain and structures for concealment
   - Maintain awareness: Do not run blindly into other threats
   - Pace yourself: Sprint if immediate, jog if sustained flight needed
   - Use obstacles: Put barriers between you and threat
   - Do not look back constantly: Glance only, focus on route ahead
   - If in group: Maintain contact, do not separate unnecessarily

   BLENDING IN (IF IN CROWDED OR URBAN AREA):
   - Match local behavior: Move like others, do not stand out
   - Avoid eye contact: Do not draw attention
   - Move with flow: Do not go against crowd movement
   - Dress appropriately: Do not look like outsider or target
   - Control body language: Calm, purposeful, not panicked
   - Use crowd as cover: Position yourself within group
   - Move toward safety gradually: Do not run unless necessary
   - Avoid confrontation: Do not engage or respond to provocation
   - Use structures: Enter buildings, alleys, or areas that provide cover

5. MAINTAIN AWARENESS DURING AVOIDANCE:
   - Do not become so focused on threat that you miss other dangers
   - Watch your route: Obstacles, terrain, other threats
   - Monitor threat position: Is it following? Getting closer? Moving away?
   - Check escape route: Is it still clear? Blocked? Dangerous?
   - Assess physical state: Can you continue? Need to rest? Injured?
   - Monitor environment: Weather, terrain, structures, other people
   - Watch for opportunities: Better hiding place, safer route, help available
   - Listen for sounds: Threat movement, other dangers, opportunities
   - Use all senses: Do not rely only on vision

6. ADAPT AS CONDITIONS CHANGE:
   - If avoidance method fails: Switch to alternative immediately
   - If route is blocked: Find new route without hesitation
   - If threat changes behavior: Reassess and adapt
   - If environment changes: Adjust method accordingly
   - If physical capability changes: Modify approach (injury, exhaustion)
   - If new threats appear: Prioritize most dangerous
   - If opportunities appear: Take advantage if safe
   - Be flexible: Rigid plans fail when conditions change

7. VERIFY THREAT IS AVOIDED:
   - Do not assume threat is gone - verify
   - Wait and observe: Give time for threat to pass or leave
   - Check multiple angles: Threat may be waiting or circling
   - Listen carefully: Sounds indicate threat position
   - Use indirect observation: Reflections, shadows, animal behavior
   - Confirm safe distance: Is threat far enough away?
   - Verify no other threats: Avoided one, but others present?
   - Do not emerge too soon: Patience prevents detection
   - When safe: Move to more secure location if possible

FOR SPECIFIC SITUATIONS / CONDITIONS:

AVOIDING ARMED THREATS:
- Maximum distance is critical: Every meter reduces accuracy
- Use cover: Solid objects stop projectiles, concealment hides you
- Move unpredictably: Zigzag, change speed, use obstacles
- Avoid open areas: Exposed movement is vulnerable
- If cover is available: Move between cover points
- If no cover: Move quickly, create distance, change direction
- If threat is shooting: Get low, use terrain, move away
- Do not return fire unless absolutely necessary for survival
- Priority: Escape, not confrontation

AVOIDING GROUPS:
- Groups are more dangerous than individuals
- Avoid entire group area, not just visible members
- Watch for group coordination: May have lookouts or patrols
- Groups can surround: Maintain awareness of all directions
- If group is moving: Let them pass, do not intercept
- If group is stationary: Give wide berth, avoid approach
- If group is searching: They may have found your trail
- Groups communicate: Your avoidance may be reported
- Priority: Avoid detection by entire group

AVOIDING IN URBAN AREAS:
- Use buildings: Enter, exit, use as cover
- Use alleys: Narrow spaces provide cover and escape routes
- Use crowds: Blend in, use as cover
- Avoid main streets: Use side streets and alleys
- Use multiple levels: Stairs, fire escapes, rooftops (if safe)
- Use vehicles: As cover, not for escape (may be targeted)
- Avoid dead ends: Always have escape route
- Use reflections: Windows, mirrors to see around corners
- Priority: Use urban features to avoid detection

AVOIDING IN RURAL/WILDERNESS:
- Use terrain: Hills, valleys, vegetation for cover
- Use natural features: Rocks, trees, water for concealment
- Avoid open areas: Fields, clearings expose you
- Use elevation: High ground provides visibility and distance
- Use water: Streams mask sound and scent (if safe to cross)
- Avoid trails: Use off-trail routes
- Use weather: Rain, fog, darkness reduce visibility
- Use animal behavior: Disturbed animals may indicate threat
- Priority: Use natural features to avoid detection

AVOIDING AT NIGHT:
- Vision is limited: Use hearing and other senses more
- Move slowly: Avoid noise and falls
- Use shadows: Dark areas provide concealment
- Avoid light sources: You are visible in light
- Use natural light: Moon, stars for navigation
- Listen carefully: Sounds indicate threat position
- Feel ground: Avoid obstacles and noise
- Use structures: Buildings, terrain for cover
- Priority: Silence and concealment over speed

AVOIDING WHEN INJURED:
- Injury limits mobility: Plan routes accordingly
- Prioritize: Avoid further injury during avoidance
- Use available mobility: Crawl, limp, whatever works
- Find hiding place: May be better than fleeing
- Use terrain: Downhill easier than uphill
- Avoid obstacles: Cannot climb or jump with injury
- Pace yourself: Cannot sustain speed with injury
- Accept help: If available and safe
- Priority: Avoid further injury while avoiding threat

AVOIDING WITH GROUP:
- Maintain contact: Do not separate unnecessarily
- Move together: Slower member sets pace
- Communicate quietly: Signals, not voice
- Watch for stragglers: Do not leave members behind
- Share awareness: Multiple eyes see more
- Coordinate movement: Avoid bunching up
- Designate roles: Some watch, some move
- Priority: Group safety, not individual speed

VITAL SIGNS TO CHECK:

YOUR PHYSICAL STATE:
- Heart rate: Elevated indicates stress, may need to pace
- Breathing: Rapid indicates panic or exhaustion
- Sweating: Excessive indicates heat stress or fear
- Muscle fatigue: Reduced capability to continue avoidance
- Pain: Injury may limit avoidance options
- Balance: Dizziness or unsteadiness increases fall risk
- Vision: Tunnel vision or blurring indicates stress
- Hearing: Ringing or reduced hearing limits awareness
- Temperature: Hot or cold indicates environmental exposure
- If physical signs indicate exhaustion or injury → trigger Medical RAG immediately

THREAT INDICATORS:
- Distance: Is threat getting closer or farther?
- Speed: Is threat moving faster or slower?
- Direction: Is threat moving toward you or away?
- Behavior: Is threat searching, pursuing, or unaware?
- Numbers: Are there more threats appearing?
- Weapons: Is threat armed? What type?
- Communication: Is threat coordinating with others?
- Awareness: Does threat know your location?
- Intent: Does threat show hostile intent?

ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS:
- Weather: Does weather help or hinder avoidance?
- Terrain: Is terrain helping or hindering movement?
- Visibility: Can you see threats? Can threats see you?
- Cover: Is cover available? Is it adequate?
- Routes: Are escape routes still clear?
- Obstacles: Are obstacles blocking routes?
- Resources: Do you have what you need to continue?
- Time: How much time before conditions change?

WHEN PROFESSIONAL HELP IS UNAVAILABLE:

YOU MUST RELY ON YOUR OWN AVOIDANCE:
- No security forces to protect you
- No law enforcement to intervene
- No safe zones or protected areas
- No rescue or extraction available
- You are responsible for your own avoidance
- Group members depend on each other
- Mistakes in avoidance can be fatal
- Time is critical - delayed avoidance reduces options
- Physical capability limits avoidance options
- Environmental conditions affect all avoidance methods

IMPROVISED AVOIDANCE METHODS:
- Use available materials: Debris, vegetation, structures for cover
- Create distractions: Noise, movement in different direction (if safe)
- Use terrain creatively: Climb, crawl, swim if necessary
- Use time: Wait for conditions to change (darkness, weather)
- Use other threats: Dangerous areas may deter pursuit (risky)
- Use deception: False trails, misleading signs (if time permits)
- Use group: Some members create diversion while others escape (last resort)
- Use knowledge: Local knowledge of area provides advantage
- Use tools: Improvised weapons or tools for defense if avoidance fails (last resort)

LONG-TERM CARE:

MAINTAINING AVOIDANCE CAPABILITY:
- Physical fitness: Regular movement maintains capability
- Route knowledge: Knowing area provides avoidance options
- Resource management: Supplies needed for sustained avoidance
- Group coordination: Practice improves group avoidance
- Stress management: Reduces panic during avoidance
- Environmental awareness: Knowledge of area and conditions
- Tool maintenance: Equipment needed for avoidance
- Rest management: Fatigue reduces avoidance capability
- Injury prevention: Injuries limit avoidance options
- Mental preparation: Preparedness improves response

PREVENTION:

PREVENTING THREAT ENCOUNTERS:
- Maintain situational awareness: Detect threats before they detect you
- Avoid known threat areas: Do not enter dangerous zones unnecessarily
- Travel during safer times: Some times are less dangerous
- Use safer routes: Longer but safer is better than shorter but dangerous
- Travel in groups: Groups are less likely targets
- Blend in: Do not appear as target or outsider
- Avoid confrontation: Do not provoke or engage unnecessarily
- Maintain resources: Desperation increases risk-taking
- Stay informed: Knowledge of threats helps avoidance
- Trust instincts: If area feels dangerous, it probably is

TRAINING AVOIDANCE SKILLS:
- Practice movement: Running, climbing, crawling under stress
- Practice hiding: Finding and using concealment quickly
- Practice route planning: Identifying escape routes rapidly
- Practice under stress: Simulated threats improve response
- Practice in different conditions: Day, night, weather, terrain
- Practice with group: Coordination improves effectiveness
- Practice with limitations: Injury, exhaustion, equipment loss
- Practice decision-making: Quick threat assessment and response
- Practice awareness: Maintaining observation during avoidance
- Practice regularly: Skills degrade without use

REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS:

WHAT AVOIDANCE CAN DO:
- Prevent most confrontations if executed early
- Create distance from most threats
- Provide time to plan further actions
- Reduce risk of injury or harm
- Enable escape from dangerous situations
- Work against most human and animal threats
- Be effective in most environmental conditions
- Improve survival odds significantly

WHAT AVOIDANCE CANNOT DO:
- Cannot prevent all threats (some are unavoidable)
- Cannot work if threat is faster or more capable
- Cannot work if you are surrounded or trapped
- Cannot work if threat has superior technology or resources
- Cannot guarantee escape (only improves odds)
- Cannot work if you are exhausted or injured beyond capability
- Cannot work if environmental conditions prevent movement
- Cannot work if threat is determined and persistent

LIMITATIONS:
- Physical capability limits avoidance options
- Environmental conditions affect all methods
- Some threats are faster or more capable
- Exhaustion reduces effectiveness over time
- Injury severely limits mobility
- Stress and panic impair decision-making
- Some situations make avoidance impossible
- Group movement is slower than individual
- Resources needed for sustained avoidance
- Some threats are persistent and will pursue

DO NOT:

- DO NOT hesitate when threat is immediate - act immediately
- DO NOT run blindly - know your route and destination
- DO NOT ignore other threats while avoiding one
- DO NOT become so focused on threat that you miss escape route obstacles
- DO NOT assume threat is gone - verify before emerging
- DO NOT make noise unnecessarily - silence aids avoidance
- DO NOT leave group members behind unnecessarily
- DO NOT drop essential supplies during avoidance
- DO NOT choose route that exposes you to other threats
- DO NOT ignore physical exhaustion - it reduces capability
- DO NOT panic - systematic response is more effective
- DO NOT assume hiding is always better than fleeing - assess situation
- DO NOT assume fleeing is always better than hiding - assess situation
- DO NOT ignore environmental conditions - they affect all methods
- DO NOT assume threat will give up - some are persistent
- DO NOT return to threat area too soon - wait and verify
- DO NOT ignore injury during avoidance - may need medical attention
- DO NOT assume avoidance alone is enough - may need other responses
- DO NOT ignore opportunities for help - if available and safe
- DO NOT assume you are safe just because you avoided one threat - others may exist
