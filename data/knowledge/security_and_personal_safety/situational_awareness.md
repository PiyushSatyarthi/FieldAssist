- Stress-induced panic or cognitive overload → Psychological Survival RAG (panic_control.md, decision_fatigue.md)
- Exposure to environmental dangers → Shelter & Environmental RAG (hypothermia_prevention.md, heat_illness_prevention.md)
- Dehydration from stress or flight → Food & Water RAG (hydration_requirements.md)
- Tool-related injury during threat response → Tools & Basic Mechanics RAG (knife_safety.md, tool_injury_prevention.md)

WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE:
- Entering unfamiliar or potentially dangerous areas
- Operating in disaster, conflict, or post-collapse environments
- Moving through areas with unknown threats
- When normal social order has broken down
- Before making decisions that could expose you to danger
- When you feel something is "off" but cannot identify why
- During any movement or activity in uncertain conditions
- When operating alone or in small groups without security support

IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES:
1. Establish baseline awareness of your immediate environment
2. Identify all potential threats and escape routes
3. Assess your current position relative to safety
4. Determine if immediate movement is required
5. Evaluate your physical and mental state (fatigue, stress, injury)
6. Check visibility and environmental conditions
7. Assess available resources and tools for defense or escape
8. Identify safe zones or areas of relative security

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Tunnel vision: Focusing on one threat while missing others
- Complacency: Assuming safety when danger exists
- Information overload: Too many signals causing paralysis
- False confidence: Believing you are safe when you are not
- Fatigue-induced lapses: Reduced awareness due to exhaustion
- Stress-induced errors: Panic causing poor decision-making
- Environmental hazards: Weather, terrain, or structural dangers
- Human threats: Hostile individuals or groups
- Animal threats: Dangerous wildlife in survival situations
- Structural collapse: Unstable buildings or terrain
- Time pressure: Delayed recognition of threats reduces response options

STEP-BY-STEP ACTIONS:

1. ESTABLISH BASELINE OBSERVATION (DO FIRST, BEFORE MOVING):
   - Stop and observe for minimum 30 seconds before entering new area
   - Use all senses: Look, listen, smell, feel
   - Identify normal sounds, sights, and patterns for this environment
   - Note anything that does not fit the baseline
   - Check for movement (people, animals, vehicles)
   - Listen for voices, footsteps, machinery, alarms
   - Smell for smoke, chemicals, decomposition, unusual odors
   - Feel for vibrations, wind changes, temperature shifts
   - Do not rush this step - it is critical for survival

2. SCAN IN LAYERS (OUTSIDE TO INSIDE):
   - Far distance (300+ meters): Look for large threats, groups, vehicles, structures
   - Mid distance (50-300 meters): Identify movement, individuals, obstacles, routes
   - Near distance (10-50 meters): Check for immediate threats, hiding places, escape routes
   - Immediate (0-10 meters): Assess your exact position, footing, cover, threats at arm's length
   - Scan systematically: Left to right, then right to left, then repeat
   - Do not fixate on one area - keep scanning
   - Use peripheral vision to detect movement
   - Check above and below your eye level
   - Look for shadows, reflections, or movement that indicates presence

3. IDENTIFY THREATS (CATEGORIZE WHAT YOU SEE):
   - Human threats: Individuals or groups showing hostile intent
   - Environmental threats: Weather, terrain, structural instability
   - Animal threats: Dangerous wildlife, aggressive domestic animals
   - Time-based threats: Approaching darkness, weather changes, resource depletion
   - Structural threats: Unstable buildings, falling debris, collapse risk
   - Chemical/biological threats: Visible contamination, unusual odors, dead animals
   - Fire threats: Smoke, flames, heat, flammable materials
   - Water threats: Flooding, fast currents, unstable banks
   - Each threat should be assessed for: Severity, Immediacy, Avoidability

4. ASSESS ESCAPE ROUTES (ALWAYS IDENTIFY MULTIPLE):
   - Primary route: Fastest path to safety
   - Secondary route: Alternative if primary is blocked
   - Emergency route: Last-resort path if others fail
   - For each route, identify:
     * Distance to safety
     * Obstacles or challenges
     * Visibility and cover available
     * Time required to reach safety
     * Physical demands (climbing, running, swimming)
   - Mark routes mentally or with subtle markers if possible
   - Do not rely on single escape route
   - Reassess routes as conditions change

5. EVALUATE YOUR POSITION (CONTINUOUS ASSESSMENT):
   - Are you visible to potential threats?
   - Do you have cover or concealment?
   - Can you move without being detected?
   - Is your position defensible if needed?
   - Can you observe without being observed?
   - Is your position exposed to environmental dangers?
   - Can you maintain awareness from this position?
   - Is your position sustainable (water, shelter, resources)?
   - Reassess every 5-10 minutes or when conditions change

6. MONITOR CHANGES (CONTINUOUS VIGILANCE):
   - Note any changes in environment: New sounds, movement, smells
   - Watch for changes in weather or light conditions
   - Monitor for approaching threats (people, animals, vehicles)
   - Check for structural changes (cracks, shifts, instability)
   - Observe changes in animal behavior (may indicate threats)
   - Watch for changes in human behavior patterns
   - Note time passage and resource consumption
   - Compare current state to baseline established earlier
   - If something changes, reassess threat level immediately

7. MANAGE INFORMATION OVERLOAD (PREVENT PARALYSIS):
   - Prioritize threats: Most dangerous first
   - Focus on actionable information: What can you do about it?
   - Ignore irrelevant details: Filter out noise
   - Use mental checklists: Systematic assessment prevents panic
   - Take breaks if possible: Brief moments to process information
   - Share observations with group: Multiple eyes see more
   - Document critical information: Mental notes or written if safe
   - Do not become overwhelmed: Focus on what matters for survival

8. MAINTAIN AWARENESS DURING ACTIVITIES:
   - Do not become so focused on task that you lose awareness
   - Pause regularly to scan environment
   - Use peripheral vision while working
   - Listen actively even while occupied
   - Position yourself to see threats while working
   - Work in shifts if in group: Some work, some watch
   - Avoid tasks that require complete focus in dangerous areas
   - If task requires full attention, do it in safer location first

FOR SPECIFIC SITUATIONS / CONDITIONS:

URBAN ENVIRONMENTS:
- Check windows, doorways, rooftops for observers
- Monitor vehicle traffic patterns
- Watch for groups forming or dispersing

VITAL SIGNS TO CHECK:

YOUR OWN PHYSICAL STATE:
- Heart rate: Elevated indicates stress or threat response
- Breathing: Rapid or shallow indicates panic or exhaustion
- Sweating: Excessive may indicate heat stress or fear response
- Trembling: May indicate fatigue, cold, or stress
- Vision: Tunnel vision indicates stress or threat focus
- Hearing: Ringing or reduced hearing may indicate stress or injury
- Balance: Dizziness or unsteadiness indicates exhaustion or injury
- Strength: Reduced grip or movement indicates fatigue
- Temperature: Hot or cold indicates environmental exposure
- Pain: Any pain indicates potential injury requiring attention
- If physical signs indicate exhaustion or injury → trigger Medical RAG immediately

YOUR MENTAL STATE:
- Clarity of thought: Confusion indicates stress or exhaustion
- Decision-making ability: Indecision indicates overload
- Memory: Difficulty remembering indicates stress
- Focus: Inability to concentrate indicates fatigue or panic
- Emotional state: Extreme fear or anger impairs judgment
- Time perception: Distorted time sense indicates stress
- If mental state is compromised → trigger Psychological Survival RAG

ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATORS:
- Temperature changes: May indicate weather shift or fire
- Wind changes: May indicate weather shift or approaching threat
- Sound changes: New sounds indicate new threats or opportunities
- Light changes: Approaching darkness or weather change
- Smell changes: May indicate fire, contamination, or presence
- Vibration: May indicate vehicles, machinery, or structural movement
- Animal behavior: Changes may indicate threats or weather
- Human activity: Changes in patterns indicate new threats or opportunities

THREAT INDICATORS:
- Direct observation: Visible threats require immediate response
- Indirect signs: Tracks, sounds, smells indicate presence
- Behavioral changes: Animals or people acting unusually
- Environmental disruption: Disturbed items, fresh damage
- Time patterns: Threats may follow predictable schedules
- Resource competition: Competition indicates scarcity and potential conflict
- Communication: Overheard conversations, signals, or warnings

WHEN PROFESSIONAL HELP IS UNAVAILABLE:

YOU MUST RELY ON YOUR OWN AWARENESS:
- No security forces or law enforcement available
- No early warning systems functioning
- No communication networks for alerts
- No professional threat assessment available
- You are responsible for your own safety
- Group members depend on shared awareness
- Mistakes in awareness can be fatal
- Continuous vigilance is required
- Fatigue will reduce awareness - manage rest carefully
- Stress will impair judgment - use systematic methods

IMPROVISED AWARENESS METHODS:
- Use available tools: Mirrors for looking around corners, sticks for probing
- Create early warning: Trip wires with noise makers (if safe to do so)
- Use natural indicators: Animal behavior, weather patterns, environmental changes
- Establish observation posts: High ground, concealed positions
- Use time patterns: Most threats follow some pattern
- Share observations: Multiple people see more than one
- Document patterns: Mental notes or written records if safe
- Use all senses: Do not rely only on vision
- Trust instincts: If something feels wrong, it often is

LONG-TERM CARE:

MAINTAINING AWARENESS OVER TIME:
- Awareness degrades with fatigue - manage rest cycles
- Stress reduces effectiveness - use stress management techniques
- Complacency develops over time - actively fight it
- Routine reduces vigilance - vary patterns and positions
- Group dynamics affect awareness - maintain communication
- Resource depletion affects awareness - manage resources
- Environmental changes require adaptation - stay flexible
- Mental fatigue impairs observation - take breaks when possible
- Physical exhaustion reduces awareness - pace activities
- Emotional stress clouds judgment - use systematic methods

PREVENTION:

PREVENTING AWARENESS FAILURES:
- Never assume safety - always verify
- Never become complacent - maintain vigilance
- Never ignore instincts - investigate concerns
- Never skip observation - always scan before acting
- Never work alone in dangerous areas - use buddy system
- Never ignore environmental changes - reassess continuously
- Never assume threats are gone - verify they have left
- Never ignore physical exhaustion - rest before it impairs awareness
- Never ignore mental fatigue - take breaks to maintain effectiveness
- Never assume you are hidden - act as if you are visible

TRAINING AWARENESS SKILLS:
- Practice observation: Regularly scan and identify details
- Practice memory: Remember and recall environmental details
- Practice pattern recognition: Identify normal vs abnormal
- Practice threat assessment: Evaluate and prioritize threats
- Practice decision-making under stress: Use systematic methods
- Practice multi-tasking: Maintain awareness while performing tasks
- Practice in different conditions: Day, night, weather, terrain
- Practice with others: Share observations and compare notes
- Practice with limited resources: Simulate survival conditions
- Practice regularly: Skills degrade without use

REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS:

WHAT AWARENESS CAN DO:
- Identify most visible threats before they become immediate
- Provide time to plan response or escape
- Reduce surprise and improve reaction time
- Help avoid dangerous situations
- Improve decision-making with better information
- Increase confidence through knowledge of environment
- Enable proactive rather than reactive responses
- Help identify opportunities as well as threats

WHAT AWARENESS CANNOT DO:
- Cannot detect all threats (some are hidden or unexpected)
- Cannot prevent all dangers (some are unavoidable)
- Cannot eliminate risk (only reduce it)
- Cannot replace security forces or professional protection
- Cannot work when exhausted or stressed beyond capacity
- Cannot see through obstacles or around all corners
- Cannot predict all threats (some are random or unpredictable)
- Cannot guarantee safety (only improve odds)

LIMITATIONS:
- Fatigue severely reduces awareness effectiveness
- Stress impairs observation and judgment
- Environmental conditions limit observation (darkness, weather, terrain)
- Some threats are designed to avoid detection
- Human attention is limited - cannot observe everything simultaneously
- False alarms are common - not every threat is real
- Over-vigilance can cause paralysis or exhaustion
- Complacency is natural and must be actively fought
- Awareness requires energy - cannot maintain maximum alertness indefinitely
- Some threats are unavoidable regardless of awareness

DO NOT:

- DO NOT assume you are safe just because you see no immediate threats
- DO NOT become so focused on one threat that you miss others
- DO NOT ignore your instincts - if something feels wrong, investigate
- DO NOT skip observation steps to save time - time saved is not worth the risk
- DO NOT become complacent in familiar areas - threats can appear anywhere
- DO NOT rely on single escape route - always identify multiple options
- DO NOT ignore environmental changes - they may indicate threats
- DO NOT work alone in dangerous areas without maintaining awareness
- DO NOT assume threats are gone - verify they have actually left
- DO NOT ignore physical or mental exhaustion - it severely reduces awareness
- DO NOT become paralyzed by information overload - prioritize and act
- DO NOT assume you are hidden - act as if you are always visible
- DO NOT ignore animal behavior changes - they often detect threats first
- DO NOT skip scanning because you are in a hurry - haste causes mistakes
- DO NOT assume others are maintaining awareness - verify and communicate
- DO NOT ignore structural dangers while watching for human threats
- DO NOT become so focused on observation that you cannot act when needed
- DO NOT assume awareness alone is enough - you must also be able to respond
- DO NOT ignore signs of stress or fatigue in yourself or group members
- DO NOT assume professional help will arrive - you are responsible for your safety
