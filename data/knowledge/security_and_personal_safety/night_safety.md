WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE:
- Operating during night hours
- Moving through areas in darkness
- Working or performing tasks at night
- When artificial light is limited or unavailable
- When you must operate without revealing your position
- Night watch or security duties
- Emergency situations occurring at night
- When normal daylight activities must continue at night
- When darkness is used for concealment or security

IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES:
1. Assess available light sources and visibility
2. Evaluate necessity of night activity: Can it wait until daylight?
3. Identify all hazards specific to night conditions
4. Plan activities to minimize night risks
5. Prepare light sources if available and safe to use
6. Assess your night vision capability
7. Identify safe routes and positions for night operations
8. Plan for reduced capability: Everything takes longer at night

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Reduced visibility: Cannot see hazards, threats, or obstacles
- Falls and injuries: Tripping, falling from height, striking objects
- Getting lost: Navigation is extremely difficult without light
- Threat detection: Cannot see threats until very close
- Environmental exposure: Temperature drops, weather changes
- Fatigue: Night operations are more exhausting
- Disorientation: Loss of sense of direction and location
- Panic: Darkness increases fear and stress
- Tool accidents: Using tools in low light increases injury risk
- Structural hazards: Cannot see unstable structures or obstacles

STEP-BY-STEP ACTIONS:

1. ASSESS NECESSITY OF NIGHT ACTIVITY (DO FIRST):
   - Is night activity required? Can it wait until daylight?
   - What is the reason? Security, emergency, or routine?
   - What are risks of waiting vs proceeding at night?
   - Is activity safer at night? (Concealment, temperature)
   - Can activity be done partially? Some parts in daylight?
   - Do you have adequate light sources? Can you operate safely?
   - Is your physical condition adequate? Rested enough for night work?
   - Is your mental condition adequate? Clear thinking, not exhausted?
   - Do not proceed at night unless necessary or night provides advantage

2. PREPARE FOR NIGHT OPERATIONS:
   - Gather light sources: Flashlights, lanterns, candles, fire (if safe)
   - Test light sources: Ensure they work before needed
   - Prepare backup lights: Multiple sources, batteries, fuel
   - Prepare navigation aids: Compass, map, landmarks
   - Prepare equipment: All tools and supplies needed
   - Prepare clothing: Warm layers, weather protection
   - Prepare shelter materials: If spending night outside
   - Prepare first aid: Injuries more likely at night
   - Inform others: If in group, share plans and timeline
   - Do not proceed without adequate preparation

3. ADAPT TO REDUCED VISIBILITY:
   - Allow dark adaptation: 20-30 minutes for eyes to adjust
   - Protect night vision: Avoid bright lights, use red light if available
   - Use peripheral vision: Better in low light than central vision
   - Use available light: Moon, stars, ambient light from surroundings
   - Use contrast: Light objects against dark, dark against light
   - Use shadows: Shadows indicate objects and terrain
   - Use silhouettes: Outlines against sky or light sources
   - Use sound: Hearing becomes more important at night
   - Use touch: Feel ground, obstacles, handholds
   - Do not rely only on vision: Use all senses

4. MANAGE LIGHT SOURCES CAREFULLY:
   - Use light only when necessary: Preserves night vision and concealment
   - Use minimum light needed: Bright light is not always better
   - Shield light: Prevent light from revealing your position
   - Use red light if available: Preserves night vision better
   - Use indirect light: Bounce light off surfaces, do not shine directly
   - Turn off when not needed: Conserves batteries and preserves vision
   - Have backup: Multiple light sources, do not depend on one
   - Do not shine light at people: Blinds them, reveals your position
   - Do not use light if it reveals you to threats: Concealment may be more important
   - Balance visibility needs with security needs

5. MOVE SAFELY AT NIGHT:
   - Move slowly: Reduced visibility requires slower movement
   - Test footing: Feel ground before committing weight
   - Use handholds: Feel before using, test stability
   - Watch for obstacles: Stairs, holes, debris, uneven ground
   - Use established paths: Known routes are safer than unknown
   - Avoid hazards: Cliffs, water, unstable structures
   - Move deliberately: Each step planned and tested
   - Use assistance: Sticks, ropes, handholds for balance
   - Rest frequently: Night movement is more exhausting
   - Do not rush: Haste causes falls and injuries

6. MAINTAIN SITUATIONAL AWARENESS:
   - Listen actively: Sounds indicate threats, hazards, opportunities
   - Use hearing more: Compensate for reduced vision
   - Scan continuously: Look in all directions, use peripheral vision
   - Monitor for movement: Movement is easier to detect than stationary objects
   - Monitor for light sources: May indicate threats or safety
   - Monitor for sounds: Voices, footsteps, machinery, animals
   - Monitor environment: Weather, temperature, terrain changes
   - Monitor your position: Easy to become disoriented at night
   - Do not become so focused on one sense that you ignore others

7. NAVIGATE ACCURATELY:
   - Use multiple methods: Compass, stars, landmarks, memory
   - Mark route: Mental notes or physical markers if safe
   - Use landmarks: Identify and remember landmarks before dark
   - Use stars: If visible, stars provide direction
   - Use compass: If available, compass is reliable
   - Use terrain association: Match terrain to map or memory
   - Check position regularly: Confirm you are on correct route
   - If lost: Stop, assess, use navigation methods, do not panic
   - Do not continue if uncertain of direction: Stop and navigate

8. MANAGE ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURE:
   - Temperature drops at night: Prepare for cold
   - Weather changes: Monitor for weather shifts
   - Wind increases: Wind chill increases cold exposure
   - Precipitation: Rain, snow reduce visibility and increase cold
   - Use clothing layers: Add layers as temperature drops
   - Use shelter: If stationary, use shelter for protection
   - Monitor body temperature: Cold and heat illness risks
   - Stay dry: Wet clothing increases cold exposure
   - Do not ignore environmental exposure: Hypothermia and heat illness are risks

9. PREVENT INJURIES:
   - Move carefully: Slow, deliberate movement prevents falls
   - Test surfaces: Feel before stepping, test stability
   - Use handholds: Feel before using, test before committing
   - Avoid hazards: Identify and avoid known hazards
   - Use tools carefully: Tool use in low light increases injury risk
   - Maintain balance: Use assistance, move slowly
   - Protect head: Use arms, be aware of overhead obstacles
   - Rest when tired: Fatigue increases injury risk
   - Do not take unnecessary risks: Safety over speed

10. MANAGE FATIGUE AND STRESS:
    - Night operations are more exhausting: Plan for rest
    - Take breaks: Regular rest prevents exhaustion
    - Manage stress: Darkness increases fear and stress
    - Stay calm: Panic impairs judgment and increases risk
    - Use systematic methods: Checklists and procedures reduce errors
    - Monitor mental state: Confusion indicates exhaustion
    - Do not ignore exhaustion: Rest before making mistakes
    - Do not ignore stress: Manage stress to maintain effectiveness
