WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE:
- Entering or being in crowded areas
- Resource distribution points (food, water, aid)
- Evacuation points or refugee areas
- Transportation hubs or checkpoints
- Areas with limited exits or narrow passages
- Events or gatherings with large numbers of people
- Panic or emergency situations in crowded areas
- Movement through dense crowds
- When crowd density is increasing
- When exits are becoming blocked

IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES:
1. Assess crowd density and exit availability immediately
2. Identify all available exits and alternative routes
3. Evaluate your position relative to exits and walls
4. Assess crowd behavior for signs of panic or agitation
5. Determine if you can safely exit now or must wait
6. Identify safe positions if you cannot exit immediately
7. Plan escape route through crowd if needed
8. Prepare for rapid movement if crowd becomes dangerous

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Crowd crush: Pressure from surrounding people causes asphyxiation
- Stampede: Panic causes uncontrolled mass movement
- Falls: Tripping in dense crowd causes trampling risk
- Exits blocked: Cannot escape if crowd blocks all exits
- Structural collapse: Overcrowding may exceed structure capacity
- Heat illness: Dense crowds generate heat, limited ventilation
- Dehydration: Limited access to water in crowded conditions
- Separation: Losing group members in dense crowd
- Panic spread: One person's panic can trigger mass panic
- Limited movement: Cannot move freely, trapped by crowd

STEP-BY-STEP ACTIONS:

1. ASSESS CROWD SITUATION IMMEDIATELY (DO FIRST):
   - Crowd density: Can you move freely? Are you pressed against others?
   - Exit availability: How many exits? Are they clear or blocked?
   - Crowd behavior: Calm and organized, or agitated and panicked?
   - Your position: Near exit, middle of crowd, or far from exits?
   - Space available: Can you raise arms? Can you breathe freely?
   - Structural condition: Is structure stable? Can it handle crowd?
   - Time factors: Is crowd growing? Are conditions deteriorating?
   - This assessment must occur immediately upon entering or noticing danger

2. IDENTIFY ALL EXITS (BEFORE ENTERING IF POSSIBLE):
   - Primary exits: Main entrances/exits, usually known
   - Secondary exits: Alternative exits, may be less obvious
   - Emergency exits: Marked emergency exits, may be blocked
   - Windows: May be usable as exits if ground level
   - Alternative routes: Through buildings, over barriers (if safe)
   - For each exit, assess:
     * Distance from your position
     * Width and capacity
     * Current crowd density at exit
     * Obstacles or barriers
     * Whether exit is functioning or blocked
   - Do not rely on single exit: Always identify multiple options
   - Mark exits mentally: Remember locations relative to your position

3. POSITION YOURSELF SAFELY:
   - Near exits: Position yourself close to exit if possible
   - Away from center: Center of crowd is hardest to escape
   - Away from walls: Walls can trap you, but also provide support
   - Near edges: Edges provide more movement options
   - Avoid bottlenecks: Narrow passages, doorways, stairwells
   - Avoid dead ends: Areas with no exit routes
   - Use structural support: Columns, walls for protection from pressure
   - Maintain space: Try to maintain personal space if possible
   - Do not position yourself where you cannot escape

4. MONITOR CROWD BEHAVIOR CONTINUOUSLY:
   - Watch for panic indicators:
     * Sudden movement in one direction
     * Screaming or shouting
     * Pushing or shoving
     * People falling
     * Rapid density increase
     * Exit blocking
   - Watch for agitation:
     * Increased noise level
     * Restless movement
     * Arguments or conflicts
     * Resource competition
   - Watch for structural stress:
     * Building movement or sounds
     * Overcrowding beyond capacity
     * Barrier failure
   - If panic indicators appear: Prepare to exit immediately
   - Do not wait until panic is full: Early exit is easier

5. MAINTAIN PERSONAL SPACE AND BREATHING:
   - Keep arms up: Creates space for chest, allows breathing
   - Do not put arms down: Reduces breathing space
   - Turn body: Angle yourself to create more space
   - Move with crowd: Do not resist flow, move with it
   - Breathe normally: Do not panic, conserve energy
   - Monitor breathing: Can you breathe freely?
   - If cannot breathe: This is critical, exit immediately
   - If pressed tightly: Try to create space, move toward exit
   - Do not allow yourself to be compressed: Compression kills

6. PLAN ESCAPE ROUTE:
   - Identify path to nearest exit: Through crowd, around obstacles
   - Identify alternative exits: If primary exit blocked
   - Identify escape timing: When to start moving toward exit
   - Identify movement method: How to move through crowd
   - Identify obstacles: People, barriers, structures to navigate
   - Identify group coordination: If in group, how to stay together
   - Practice route mentally: Visualize movement path
   - Be ready to execute: When conditions require exit
   - Do not wait until exit is impossible: Early movement is easier

7. EXECUTE EXIT IF CONDITIONS DETERIORATE:
   - Start moving early: Do not wait until panic or crush
   - Move diagonally: Through crowd toward exit, not directly
   - Move with flow: Use crowd movement to assist your movement
   - Use gaps: Move through spaces between people
   - Maintain balance: Do not fall, falling is extremely dangerous
   - Keep moving: Do not stop in middle of crowd
   - Protect yourself: Arms up, protect head and chest
   - If in group: Maintain contact, do not separate unnecessarily
   - If exit blocked: Find alternative immediately
   - Do not panic: Calm movement is more effective

8. RESPOND TO STAMPEDE OR PANIC:
   - If stampede starts: Move with flow, do not resist
   - Stay on feet: Falling is extremely dangerous
   - Move toward exit: Use crowd movement to reach exit
   - Avoid obstacles: Do not trip over barriers or fallen people
   - Protect head: Use arms to protect head from impacts
   - Breathe: Try to maintain breathing space
   - Do not fight crowd: Resistance is futile and dangerous
   - Do not try to help fallen people: You will also fall
   - Priority: Your survival, then help others if possible
   - If you fall: Try to get up immediately, protect head, curl into ball

9. IF TRAPPED IN CROWD:
   - Maintain breathing space: Keep arms up, create chest room
   - Move slowly: Try to work toward exit gradually
   - Use structural support: Lean against walls, columns for stability
   - Communicate: If possible, coordinate with nearby people
   - Wait for opportunity: Crowd may shift, creating escape path
   - Do not panic: Panic wastes energy and reduces thinking
   - Do not give up: Continue trying to reach exit
   - Monitor conditions: Crowd may clear, exit may open
   - Prepare for rapid movement: Be ready if opportunity appears

10. AFTER EXITING:
    - Move away from exit: Do not block exit for others
    - Move to safe distance: Away from crowd and structure
    - Assess condition: Physical state, injuries, group members
    - Rest if needed: Crowd situations are physically exhausting
    - Help others if safe: Assist if you can do so safely
    - Do not re-enter: Do not go back into dangerous crowd
    - Do not block exits: Allow others to exit
    - Monitor situation: Crowd may spread, new dangers may appear

FOR SPECIFIC SITUATIONS / CONDITIONS:

RESOURCE DISTRIBUTION POINTS:

VITAL SIGNS TO CHECK:

CROWD DENSITY INDICATORS:
- Personal space: Can you raise arms? Can you move?
- Breathing: Can you breathe freely? Is chest compressed?
- Movement: Can you move freely? Are you trapped?
- Exit visibility: Can you see exits? Are they blocked?
- Crowd flow: Is crowd moving? In what direction?
- Noise level: Increasing noise indicates agitation
- These signs indicate if crowd is becoming dangerous

YOUR PHYSICAL STATE:
- Breathing: Difficulty breathing indicates compression
- Pressure: Feeling compressed indicates dangerous density
- Balance: Difficulty maintaining balance indicates danger
- Temperature: Overheating indicates poor ventilation
- Thirst: Dehydration risk in crowded conditions
- Exhaustion: Physical fatigue reduces capability
- If physical signs indicate problems → trigger Medical RAG immediately

CROWD BEHAVIOR INDICATORS:
- Movement patterns: Organized (good) or chaotic (bad)
- Noise level: Normal (good) or increasing (bad)
- Conflicts: Absence (good) or presence (bad)
- Exit usage: Flowing (good) or blocked (bad)
- Density: Stable (good) or increasing (bad)
- These signs indicate if crowd is becoming dangerous

STRUCTURAL INDICATORS:
- Building movement: Any movement indicates stress
- Sounds: Creaking, cracking indicates structural stress
- Overcrowding: Beyond designed capacity is dangerous
- Barrier condition: Are barriers holding? Failing?
- Exit function: Are exits working? Blocked?
- These signs indicate if structure is safe

WHEN PROFESSIONAL HELP IS UNAVAILABLE:

YOU MUST RELY ON YOUR OWN AWARENESS AND ACTION:
- No crowd control personnel available
- No security forces to manage crowd

REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS:

WHAT CROWD SAFETY AWARENESS CAN DO:
- Prevent most crowd-related injuries if applied early
- Enable escape from most crowd dangers
- Reduce panic risk through early action
- Improve survival odds significantly in crowded conditions
- Work in most crowd situations with proper awareness
- Enable group coordination and safety
- Provide time to plan and execute escape

WHAT CROWD SAFETY AWARENESS CANNOT DO:
- Cannot prevent all crowd dangers (some are unavoidable)
- Cannot work if you are already trapped in center
- Cannot work if all exits are blocked
- Cannot prevent stampede once it starts (only improve survival)
- Cannot guarantee escape (only improves odds)
- Cannot work if you are physically incapable
- Cannot work if panic is already widespread
- Cannot prevent structural collapse if structure is overloaded

LIMITATIONS:
- Once trapped in center, escape is extremely difficult
- Once panic starts, individual control is limited
- Physical capability affects escape ability
- Some crowds are too dense to move through
- Some structures have too few exits
- Exhaustion reduces effectiveness over time
- Injury severely limits mobility in crowds
- Group movement is slower than individual
- Some conditions make crowds dangerous regardless of awareness
- Time is critical: Early action is essential

DO NOT:

- DO NOT enter crowded areas without identifying exits first
- DO NOT position yourself in center of crowd: Hardest to escape
- DO NOT ignore density: High density is dangerous
- DO NOT ignore panic indicators: Early exit is easier
- DO NOT wait until exit is impossible: Act early
- DO NOT resist crowd flow: Move with it, use it
- DO NOT panic: Panic wastes energy and reduces thinking
- DO NOT fall: Falling in crowd is extremely dangerous
- DO NOT block exits: Allow others to exit, maintain flow
- DO NOT assume crowd is safe: Continuously monitor conditions
- DO NOT ignore breathing difficulty: Compression can kill quickly
- DO NOT separate from group unnecessarily: Groups provide safety
- DO NOT assume structure is safe: Overcrowding can exceed capacity
- DO NOT ignore structural stress: Buildings can collapse
- DO NOT re-enter dangerous crowd: Once out, stay out
- DO NOT assume you can help fallen people: You will also fall
- DO NOT fight crowd: Resistance is futile and dangerous
- DO NOT ignore early warning signs: Act before panic starts
- DO NOT assume professional help will arrive: You are responsible
- DO NOT let guard down: Maintain awareness throughout time in crowd
