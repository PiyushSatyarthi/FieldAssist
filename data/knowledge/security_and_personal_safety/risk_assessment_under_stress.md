- Critical: High stress, severe cognitive impairment, immediate decisions required

PRIMARY DOMAIN: security_and_personal_safety

CROSS-RAG TRIGGERS:
- Physical injury from poor decisions → Medical RAG (all injury files as applicable)
- Severe stress or panic → Psychological Survival RAG (panic_control.md, stress_management.md, decision_fatigue.md, cognitive_overload.md)
- Environmental exposure from poor risk assessment → Shelter & Environmental RAG (all environmental files as applicable)

WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE:
- Making decisions under stress or pressure
- Assessing risks when time is limited
- Evaluating threats when information is incomplete
- Making decisions when exhausted or fatigued
- Assessing risks when multiple threats are present
- Making decisions when normal thinking is impaired
- Evaluating options when all choices involve risk
- Assessing risks when you are panicked or afraid
- Making decisions that affect survival
- When cognitive function is compromised

IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES:
1. Recognize that stress is affecting your thinking
2. Use systematic methods to compensate for stress
3. Identify the most critical risks first
4. Evaluate options using structured approach
5. Make decision based on risk assessment, not emotion
6. Monitor your mental state continuously
7. Use available time effectively: Do not rush unnecessarily
8. Seek input from others if in group and time permits

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Cognitive impairment: Stress reduces thinking ability
- Tunnel vision: Focusing on one risk while missing others
- Panic decisions: Fear causing poor choices
- Analysis paralysis: Overthinking when action is needed
- Rushed decisions: Haste causing mistakes
- Emotional decisions: Anger, fear, hope clouding judgment
- Fatigue decisions: Exhaustion impairing judgment
- Ignoring risks: Denial or wishful thinking
- Overestimating risks: Paranoia causing poor decisions
- Underestimating risks: Overconfidence causing mistakes

STEP-BY-STEP ACTIONS:

1. RECOGNIZE STRESS IMPACT (DO FIRST):
   - Acknowledge you are under stress: Denial prevents adaptation
   - Identify stress sources: Threat, exhaustion, fear, uncertainty
   - Assess stress level: Low, moderate, or high?
   - Assess thinking clarity: Can you think clearly?
   - Assess emotional state: Are emotions affecting judgment?
   - Assess physical state: Is exhaustion affecting thinking?
   - Assess time pressure: How much time do you have?
   - Assess information available: What do you know? What is unknown?
   - Do not assume stress is not affecting you: It always does

2. USE SYSTEMATIC RISK ASSESSMENT METHOD:

   IDENTIFY ALL RISKS:
   - List every risk you can identify: Do not skip "obvious" ones
   - Include risks you hope are not real: Wishful thinking is dangerous
   - Include risks others might see: Different perspectives help
   - Include immediate risks: Threats happening now
   - Include future risks: Threats that may develop
   - Include secondary risks: Risks created by your actions
   - Include environmental risks: Weather, terrain, structures
   - Include human risks: Other people, groups, conflicts
   - Include resource risks: Running out of supplies
   - Include physical risks: Injury, exhaustion, illness
   - Do not stop at first risk: Multiple risks usually exist

   CATEGORIZE RISKS BY SEVERITY:
   - Critical: Immediate threat to life, must address now
   - Serious: Significant threat, should address soon
   - Moderate: Manageable threat, can address when possible
   - Low: Minor threat, monitor but may not need action
   - For each risk, ask: "If this happens, can I survive?"
   - Prioritize critical risks: Address most dangerous first
   - Do not ignore low risks: They can become serious
   - Do not focus only on critical: Other risks matter too

   CATEGORIZE RISKS BY PROBABILITY:
   - High probability: Likely to happen
   - Medium probability: Could happen
   - Low probability: Unlikely but possible
   - For each risk, ask: "How likely is this to happen?"
   - Consider evidence: What indicates this risk is real?
   - Consider patterns: Have similar risks happened before?
   - Consider conditions: Do current conditions increase risk?
   - Do not assume low probability means safe: Low probability risks can kill
   - Do not assume high probability means inevitable: You may be able to prevent

   EVALUATE RISK INTERACTIONS:
   - Do risks combine? Multiple risks together are worse
   - Do risks conflict? Addressing one may increase another
   - Do risks cascade? One risk triggering others
   - Do risks cancel? Some risks may reduce others
   - Consider worst case: What if multiple risks happen together?
   - Consider best case: What if risks are avoided?
   - Consider most likely: What is most probable outcome?
   - Do not assess risks in isolation: They interact

3. EVALUATE OPTIONS SYSTEMATICALLY:

   IDENTIFY ALL OPTIONS:
   - List every option: Do not limit yourself to obvious choices
   - Include "do nothing": Sometimes waiting is an option
   - Include partial actions: You may not need to do everything
   - Include unconventional options: Creative solutions may work
   - Include options you do not like: Unpleasant may be necessary
   - Include options that seem impossible: May be possible with effort
   - Do not stop at first option: Multiple options usually exist
   - Do not assume you know all options: Think creatively

   EVALUATE EACH OPTION:
   - What are benefits? What does this option achieve?
   - What are risks? What could go wrong?
   - What are costs? Resources, time, effort required?
   - What are requirements? What is needed to execute?
   - What is probability of success? How likely is it to work?
   - What are consequences of failure? What happens if it fails?
   - What are secondary effects? What else does this affect?
   - Use structured evaluation: Systematic approach prevents emotion

   COMPARE OPTIONS:
   - Rank by risk: Which has lowest risk?
   - Rank by benefit: Which has highest benefit?
   - Rank by probability: Which is most likely to succeed?
   - Rank by cost: Which requires fewest resources?
   - Rank by time: Which can be done fastest?
   - Consider trade-offs: No option is perfect
   - Consider your capability: Can you actually do this?
   - Consider conditions: Will conditions allow this?
   - Do not choose based on emotion: Use logic and analysis

4. MAKE DECISION USING STRUCTURED APPROACH:
   - Use decision criteria: What matters most? Life, resources, time?
   - Consider worst case: Can you survive worst outcome?
   - Consider best case: Is best outcome worth risk?
   - Consider most likely: What is probable outcome?
   - Consider your values: What do you prioritize?
   - Consider group needs: If in group, what do others need?
   - Make decision: Choose based on analysis, not emotion
   - Commit to decision: Second-guessing wastes time and energy
   - Do not delay unnecessarily: Analysis paralysis is dangerous
   - Do not rush unnecessarily: Haste causes mistakes

5. MONITOR DECISION AND ADAPT:
   - Execute decision: Act on your choice
   - Monitor results: Is decision working as expected?
   - Monitor risks: Are risks developing as assessed?
   - Monitor conditions: Are conditions changing?
   - Adapt if needed: Change course if decision is failing
   - Do not stick to bad decision: Adaptability is essential
   - Do not change good decision: Second-guessing can be harmful
   - Balance commitment with flexibility: Know when to adapt

6. MANAGE COGNITIVE LOAD:
   - Break complex decisions into parts: Smaller decisions are easier
   - Focus on critical factors: Ignore irrelevant details
   - Use checklists: Written or mental lists prevent forgetting
   - Delegate if in group: Share decision-making load
   - Take breaks if possible: Brief rest improves thinking
   - Simplify when possible: Simpler decisions are better under stress
   - Do not try to consider everything: Focus on what matters
   - Do not overthink: Analysis has diminishing returns

7. COMPENSATE FOR STRESS EFFECTS:
   - Slow down thinking: Rushed thinking causes errors
   - Double-check critical decisions: Verify important choices
   - Use written notes: Memory is unreliable under stress
   - Use systematic methods: Structure compensates for impairment
   - Use others' input: Different perspectives help
   - Acknowledge uncertainty: You may not know everything
   - Accept imperfection: No decision is perfect
   - Do not assume you are thinking clearly: Stress impairs judgment
