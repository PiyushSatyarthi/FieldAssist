WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE:
- Assessing safety of existing shelter or home
- Selecting shelter location
- Securing shelter or home
- Identifying structural hazards
- Responding to security threats to shelter
- Maintaining shelter safety over time
- Evacuating unsafe shelter
- Improvising shelter security
- When normal security systems are unavailable
- When structures are damaged or compromised

IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES:
1. Assess structural stability immediately upon entering
2. Identify all entry points and security vulnerabilities
3. Evaluate immediate threats: Structural, security, environmental
4. Determine if shelter is safe to occupy
5. Identify escape routes from shelter
6. Assess resources available in shelter
7. Plan security measures if staying
8. Plan evacuation if shelter is unsafe

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Structural collapse: Unstable buildings can collapse without warning
- Fire: Fires spread quickly in structures, smoke kills faster than flames
- Carbon monoxide: Odorless, colorless gas can kill silently
- Security breaches: Unauthorized entry by threats
- Environmental exposure: Poor insulation, leaks, drafts
- Falling debris: Ceilings, walls, fixtures can fall
- Electrical hazards: Exposed wires, faulty systems
- Gas leaks: Explosive and toxic gas risks
- Trapped: Blocked exits prevent escape
- Poor ventilation: Stale air, smoke, gas accumulation

STEP-BY-STEP ACTIONS:

1. ASSESS STRUCTURAL STABILITY (DO FIRST UPON ENTERING):
   - Check foundation: Cracks, shifting, settling
   - Check walls: Cracks, bulging, leaning, damage
   - Check ceiling: Sagging, cracks, water damage, loose materials
   - Check floors: Sagging, soft spots, holes, instability
   - Check roof: Visible from inside, sagging, leaks, damage
   - Check support structures: Beams, columns, load-bearing walls
   - Check for recent damage: Fresh cracks, new settling, recent events
   - Check for movement: Does structure move or shift?
   - Check for sounds: Creaking, cracking, shifting sounds
   - If structure is unstable: Do not enter, find alternative shelter

2. IDENTIFY ALL ENTRY POINTS:
   - Main doors: Front, back, side entrances
   - Windows: All windows, including basement and upper floors
   - Secondary entries: Garages, basements, utility access
   - Roof access: Skylights, roof hatches, accessible roofs
   - Utility access: Vents, crawl spaces, utility tunnels
   - Damaged areas: Holes, broken windows, damaged walls
   - For each entry point, assess:
     * Can it be secured? Locked, barricaded, monitored?
     * Is it visible? Can threats see it?
     * Is it accessible? Can threats reach it?
     * Is it necessary? Can it be blocked permanently?
   - Do not assume all entries are obvious: Check thoroughly

3. ASSESS SECURITY VULNERABILITIES:
   - Visibility: Can shelter be seen from outside? From distance?
   - Accessibility: Can threats approach without being seen?
   - Defensibility: Can entry points be defended or monitored?
   - Escape routes: Are there multiple ways out if needed?
   - Observation points: Can you see threats approaching?
   - Concealment: Does shelter blend in or stand out?
   - Neighbors: Are other people nearby? Threat or asset?
   - Resources visible: Can resources be seen from outside?
   - Markings: Are there signs that indicate occupancy or resources?
   - Do not assume shelter is secure: Assess all vulnerabilities

4. CHECK FOR IMMEDIATE HAZARDS:
   - Fire hazards: Flammable materials, open flames, faulty wiring
   - Gas leaks: Smell for gas, check appliances, check for leaks
   - Electrical hazards: Exposed wires, faulty outlets, water near electricity
   - Carbon monoxide sources: Generators, heaters, engines indoors
   - Water damage: Leaks, flooding, mold, structural damage
   - Falling hazards: Loose fixtures, unstable shelves, hanging objects
   - Chemical hazards: Stored chemicals, cleaning supplies, fuel
   - Asbestos or lead: In older structures, may be present
   - If hazards are present: Address immediately or evacuate

5. ASSESS ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS:
   - Temperature: Is shelter warm enough? Cool enough?
   - Ventilation: Is air fresh? Stale? Contaminated?
   - Moisture: Is shelter dry? Damp? Leaking?
   - Light: Is there adequate light? Natural or artificial?
   - Noise: Can you hear threats? Can threats hear you?
   - Privacy: Can you be observed? Can you observe threats?
   - Space: Is there adequate space for occupants and activities?
   - If conditions are inadequate: Address or find alternative

6. PLAN SECURITY MEASURES:
   - Secure entry points: Lock, barricade, reinforce
   - Establish watch: Rotating watch if in group
   - Create early warning: Noise makers, trip wires (if safe)
   - Control visibility: Block windows, reduce light emission
   - Control noise: Reduce sounds that reveal presence
   - Establish communication: Signals, codes, coordination
   - Prepare defense: If necessary and safe, prepare defensive measures
   - Prepare escape: Multiple escape routes, escape plans
   - Do not make security obvious: Obvious security may attract attention
   - Balance security with functionality: Over-securing can trap you

7. ESTABLISH ESCAPE ROUTES:
   - Primary exit: Main door, most direct route
   - Secondary exit: Alternative door, window, or route
   - Emergency exit: Last resort, may require breaking barrier
   - For each route, assess:
     * Distance to safety
     * Obstacles or challenges
     * Visibility and cover
     * Time required
     * Physical demands
   - Test routes: Ensure they are actually usable
   - Mark routes: Remember locations, keep clear
   - Do not rely on single exit: Always have alternatives
   - Reassess routes regularly: Conditions change

8. SECURE ENTRY POINTS:
   - Lock doors: Use existing locks, add improvised locks
   - Barricade if necessary: Furniture, boards, materials
   - Reinforce weak points: Weak doors, windows, frames
   - Block unnecessary entries: Permanently block unused entries
   - Monitor entries: Watch, listen, check regularly
   - Use alarms: Noise makers, trip wires (if safe and appropriate)
   - Control access: Who enters, when, why
   - Do not over-secure: Must be able to exit quickly if needed
   - Balance security with escape: Do not trap yourself

9. MAINTAIN SHELTER SAFETY:
   - Monitor structure: Regular checks for new damage or movement
   - Monitor security: Regular checks of entry points and perimeter
   - Monitor hazards: Fire, gas, electrical, falling objects
   - Monitor environment: Temperature, ventilation, moisture
   - Maintain security measures: Locks, barricades, alarms
   - Maintain escape routes: Keep clear, test regularly
   - Maintain awareness: Continuous vigilance for threats
   - Address problems immediately: Do not ignore safety issues
   - Do not become complacent: Safety requires continuous attention

10. RESPOND TO THREATS:
    - If structure becomes unsafe: Evacuate immediately
    - If security is breached: Use escape route, do not confront unless necessary
    - If fire starts: Evacuate immediately, do not try to fight large fires
    - If gas leak detected: Evacuate immediately, do not use electrical devices
    - If threat approaches: Use de-escalation or escape, do not panic
    - If trapped: Use emergency exit, break barrier if necessary
    - Adapt to conditions: Threats and conditions change
    - Do not ignore threats: Early response is easier than late response
