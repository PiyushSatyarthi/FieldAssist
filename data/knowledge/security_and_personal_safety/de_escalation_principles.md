WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE:
- Confrontation is unavoidable and you cannot escape
- Verbal conflict is escalating toward violence
- Hostile individual is blocking your path or threatening you
- Resource competition is creating conflict
- Group tensions are escalating
- You must interact with potentially hostile individuals
- Negotiation or communication may prevent violence
- You have no other option but to engage verbally
- When avoidance is not possible and confrontation is imminent

IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES:
1. Assess if de-escalation is possible or if violence is inevitable
2. Evaluate threat level and intent of hostile party
3. Determine your physical position relative to threat
4. Identify escape routes if de-escalation fails
5. Assess available resources for negotiation or trade
6. Evaluate group dynamics if multiple parties involved
7. Determine if you have anything the threat wants
8. Decide on de-escalation approach based on threat type

IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- Escalation: Wrong words or actions make situation worse
- False confidence: Believing de-escalation will work when it will not
- Delayed response: Waiting too long to attempt de-escalation
- Provocation: Accidental words or actions that trigger violence
- Resource loss: Giving away essential supplies to appease threat
- Time waste: Attempting de-escalation when immediate escape is needed
- Group dynamics: Multiple hostile parties cannot be de-escalated easily
- Armed threats: De-escalation may not work against determined armed individuals
- Mental state: Threat may be irrational, intoxicated, or beyond reasoning
- Physical position: Poor positioning makes you vulnerable if de-escalation fails

STEP-BY-STEP ACTIONS:

1. ASSESS SITUATION IMMEDIATELY (DO FIRST):
   - Is de-escalation possible? Some threats cannot be de-escalated
   - What does threat want? Resource, information, dominance, or violence?
   - Is threat rational? Intoxicated, mentally ill, or enraged individuals are harder
   - Is threat alone or in group? Groups are harder to de-escalate
   - Is threat armed? Armed threats require different approach
   - What is threat's emotional state? Fear, anger, desperation, or aggression?
   - How much time do you have? Immediate threat vs developing situation
   - What are your options? De-escalate, escape, or defend (in that order)
   - This assessment must occur in seconds

2. POSITION YOURSELF SAFELY:
   - Maintain safe distance: At least arm's length, more if possible
   - Do not turn your back: Keep threat in view
   - Position for escape: Know your exit route
   - Avoid cornering yourself: Do not back into dead end
   - Keep hands visible: Do not appear to be reaching for weapon
   - Stand at angle: Not directly facing (less threatening) but not side-on (vulnerable)
   - Lower center of gravity: Slightly bent knees, balanced stance
   - If sitting: Stand slowly, do not make sudden movements
   - If threat has weapon: Maximum distance, hands clearly visible

3. CONTROL YOUR OWN BEHAVIOR:
   - Remain calm: Your calm can influence threat's behavior
   - Control breathing: Slow, deep breaths reduce panic
   - Control voice: Calm, steady tone, not high-pitched or aggressive
   - Control body language: Non-threatening posture, open hands
   - Control eye contact: Direct but not challenging, look at face not eyes
   - Control movements: Slow, deliberate, no sudden gestures
   - Control emotions: Fear and anger will escalate situation
   - Control reactions: Do not respond to insults or provocation
   - If you cannot control yourself: De-escalation will likely fail

4. USE VERBAL DE-ESCALATION TECHNIQUES:

   ACKNOWLEDGE AND VALIDATE:
   - Acknowledge threat's concerns: "I understand you're frustrated"
   - Validate their feelings: "I can see why you're upset"
   - Do not agree with threats: Acknowledge without conceding
   - Show you are listening: Nod, maintain attention
   - Repeat their concerns: Shows you understand
   - Do not dismiss or minimize: This escalates conflict

   USE CALM, RESPECTFUL LANGUAGE:
   - Speak slowly and clearly: Rushed speech indicates fear or aggression
   - Use respectful terms: "Sir," "Ma'am," or neutral terms
   - Avoid aggressive language: No threats, insults, or challenges
   - Avoid defensive language: "I didn't do anything" escalates
   - Use "I" statements: "I want to help" not "You need to calm down"
   - Ask questions: "What can I do to help?" shows willingness
   - Offer solutions: "Maybe we can work this out"
   - Do not make demands: Demands escalate conflict

   SET BOUNDARIES CALMLY:
   - State your needs: "I need to keep my distance for safety"
   - Explain your actions: "I'm moving slowly so I don't startle you"
   - Do not make threats: Boundaries are not threats
   - Be firm but respectful: Clear limits without aggression
   - Offer alternatives: "Instead of that, how about this?"
   - Do not back down on safety: Some boundaries are non-negotiable

5. IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS ROOT CAUSE:
   - What does threat actually want? Resource, respect, safety, or violence?
   - If resource competition: Can you share or trade?
   - If territorial: Can you leave or negotiate passage?
   - If fear-based: Can you show you are not threat?
   - If dominance: Can you show respect without submission?
   - If desperation: Can you offer help or resource?
   - Address the need, not just the behavior
   - Do not assume you know what threat wants - ask or observe

6. OFFER SOLUTIONS OR COMPROMISES:
   - If threat wants resource: Can you share, trade, or give non-essential item?
   - If threat wants passage: Can you step aside or take different route?
   - If threat wants information: Can you provide non-critical information?
   - If threat wants respect: Can you show respect without losing dignity?
   - If threat wants safety: Can you show you are not threat?
   - Offer win-win solutions: Both parties benefit
   - Do not offer everything: Maintain essential resources
   - Do not offer what you cannot deliver: False promises escalate

7. MONITOR THREAT'S RESPONSE:
   - Is threat calming down? Reduced tension, slower speech, relaxed posture
   - Is threat escalating? Increased tension, faster speech, aggressive posture
   - Is threat listening? Paying attention, responding to your words
   - Is threat rational? Can they reason or are they beyond reasoning?
   - Is threat's position changing? Moving closer (bad) or farther (good)?
   - Are others joining? More threats make de-escalation harder
   - Adjust your approach based on threat's response
   - If de-escalation is working: Continue, do not rush
   - If de-escalation is failing: Prepare for escape or defense

8. KNOW WHEN TO STOP DE-ESCALATION:
   - If threat is not responding: May be beyond de-escalation
   - If threat is escalating despite your efforts: De-escalation is failing
   - If threat is moving to attack: De-escalation has failed
   - If threat is irrational or intoxicated: May not respond to reason
   - If multiple threats: Groups are harder to de-escalate
   - If threat has weapon and is determined: May not be de-escalatable
   - If you are in immediate danger: Escape or defense may be needed
   - Do not continue de-escalation when it is clearly failing
   - Transition to escape or defense if de-escalation fails

9. EXIT SAFELY IF DE-ESCALATION SUCCEEDS:
   - Do not rush: Sudden movement may restart conflict
   - Thank threat: "Thank you for working with me"
   - Move slowly: Deliberate, non-threatening movement
   - Maintain awareness: Threat may change mind
   - Do not turn back immediately: Keep threat in view
   - Create distance gradually: Do not run unless necessary
   - Verify threat is not following: Check periodically
   - Move to safer location: Do not remain in area

VITAL SIGNS TO CHECK:

THREAT'S PHYSICAL STATE:
- Posture: Relaxed (good) or tense (bad)

WHEN PROFESSIONAL HELP IS UNAVAILABLE:

YOU MUST RELY ON YOUR OWN DE-ESCALATION:
- No law enforcement to intervene
- No security forces to protect you
- No mediators or negotiators available
- No safe zones to retreat to
- You are responsible for preventing violence
- Group members depend on your ability
- Mistakes in de-escalation can be fatal
- Time is limited - must work quickly
- Resources may be limited for negotiation
- Some threats cannot be de-escalated

IMPROVISED DE-ESCALATION METHODS:
- Use available resources: Trade items for safety
- Use knowledge: Information may be valuable
- Use skills: Offer services in exchange for safety
- Use time: Delay may allow threat to calm
- Use environment: Change location may reduce tension
- Use group: Others may help de-escalate
- Use distraction: Redirect attention (risky, may backfire)
- Use respect: Acknowledgment may be enough
- Use exit: Leaving may be best de-escalation

LONG-TERM CARE:

MAINTAINING DE-ESCALATION CAPABILITY:

- Practice regularly: Skills degrade without use
- Practice with limitations: Stress, exhaustion, injury

REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS:

WHAT DE-ESCALATION CAN DO:
- Prevent most conflicts if attempted early
- Reduce violence risk significantly
- Create time for escape or other solutions
- Resolve resource competition peacefully
- Reduce injury risk for all parties
- Maintain relationships for future interactions
- Work against most rational threats
- Be effective in most non-armed confrontations

WHAT DE-ESCALATION CANNOT DO:
- Cannot work against all threats (some are determined)
- Cannot work if threat is irrational or intoxicated
- Cannot work if threat wants violence specifically
- Cannot work against armed and determined threats
- Cannot guarantee success (only improves odds)
- Cannot work if you cannot remain calm
- Cannot work if threat is in group and group wants violence
- Cannot work if time is too limited

LIMITATIONS:
- Some threats cannot be de-escalated
- Requires calm and control you may not have under stress
- Requires time you may not have
- Requires resources you may not have for negotiation
- May not work against groups
- May not work against armed threats
- May not work if threat is irrational
- May waste time when escape is needed
- May give away resources unnecessarily
- May not work if threat's goal is violence

DO NOT:

- DO NOT continue de-escalation when it is clearly failing
- DO NOT give away all resources: Maintain essential supplies
- DO NOT submit completely: Maintain dignity and safety boundaries
- DO NOT make threats: Threats escalate conflict
- DO NOT challenge threat: Challenges escalate conflict
- DO NOT ignore escalation signs: If threat is escalating, de-escalation is failing
- DO NOT assume de-escalation will always work: Some threats cannot be de-escalated
- DO NOT waste time: If de-escalation is not working, escape or defend
- DO NOT panic: Your panic will escalate situation
- DO NOT become aggressive: Aggression escalates conflict
- DO NOT ignore your own safety: De-escalation should not put you in danger
- DO NOT assume threat is rational: Some threats are beyond reasoning
- DO NOT try to de-escalate armed and determined threats: May not be possible
- DO NOT ignore escape routes: Always know how to escape if de-escalation fails
- DO NOT continue if threat is attacking: De-escalation has failed, defend or escape
- DO NOT assume one technique works for all: Adapt to situation
- DO NOT ignore group dynamics: Groups are harder to de-escalate
- DO NOT waste essential resources: Maintain survival needs
- DO NOT assume de-escalation is always best: Sometimes escape is better
- DO NOT ignore your instincts: If situation feels dangerous, it probably is
