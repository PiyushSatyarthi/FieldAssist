STEP-BY-STEP ACTIONS:

1. ASSESS MOVEMENT NECESSITY (DO FIRST):
   - Is movement required? Can you stay where you are?
   - What is the reason for movement? Water, food, shelter, safety, or other?
   - Is current location unsafe? Immediate threat or deteriorating conditions?
   - Is destination safer? Will movement improve your situation?
   - What are risks of staying vs moving? Compare both options
   - Can movement be delayed? Is there time to wait for better conditions?
   - Do you have resources for movement? Supplies, equipment, information?
   - Can you complete movement safely? Physical capability and route safety?
   - Do not move unless necessary or movement improves safety

2. PLAN ROUTE CAREFULLY:
   - Identify destination: Exact location, not general area
   - Map route: Use map if available, mental map if not
   - Identify waypoints: Landmarks to confirm you are on route
   - Evaluate route options: Multiple routes, choose safest
   - Assess route hazards: Terrain, threats, obstacles for each route
   - Estimate distance: How far must you travel?
   - Estimate time: How long will movement take?
   - Identify rest points: Places to rest safely along route
   - Identify water sources: If movement is long
   - Identify escape routes: Alternative paths if route becomes dangerous
   - Mark dangerous areas: Areas to avoid or move through quickly
   - Plan for contingencies: What if route is blocked? What if conditions change?

3. ASSESS TIMING:
   - Is this the best time to move? Day, night, weather conditions
   - Are threats less active at certain times? Use that time
   - Is weather favorable? Avoid moving in dangerous weather
   - Is visibility adequate? Can you see hazards and threats?
   - Is physical condition adequate? Rested enough for movement?
